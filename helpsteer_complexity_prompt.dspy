It is very encouraging.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Barnier said he \"strongly opposes\" the Chequers proposal to create a free trade area in goods between the EU and UK. The plan would also establish an unprecedented facilitated customs arrangement to avoid border checks while allowing the UK to have its own trade policy outside the customs union.\n\nBarnier said the proposal would destroy the European project and he instead offered a Canada-style trade deal \u2013 which would significantly hinder the British economy, and offer no solutions to the Irish border issue \u2013 or a Norway-style model, in which the UK would have to drop key red lines, including on the free movement of people.\n\nRees-Mogg also defended Boris Johnson from Downing Street's suggestion that the former foreign secretary's recent column in the Daily Telegraph, in which he dismissed the problem of the Irish border as being exaggerated, had contained \"no new ideas\".\n\n\"Downing Street only criticises politicians about whom it is afeared,\" Rees-Mogg said. \"If Mr Johnson were as weak as they seemed to say, when you said, 'What do you think about Mr Johnson', they would say, 'Who?' But instead they go into these complex arguments that is not a sign of strength.\"\n\nWith regard to the \"backstop\" solution that the UK has committed to find, to snap into place until a free trade deal or bespoke technological solution to avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is available, Rees-Mogg suggested the issue should not be allowed to poison the talks.\n\nAsked whether the commitment to find a joint solution should be repudiated, the MP, who is chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, said: \"Yes. I think because the agreement has allowed these negotiations to drag on in a most unsatisfactory way.\n\n\"And the answer on the Irish border is simply not to put an Irish border in because the Irish gov said they don't want one, the EU said they don't want one and the British government said they don't want one. That seems to me to be a very good answer.\"\n\"\"\"\nWhat are the key takeaways from this text about the UK's current political situation regarding Brexit?  Write at least 5 bullet points for UK news consumers.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab\u2022 Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent Brexiter, met with Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, and both agreed that Theresa May's Chequers plan is \"complete rubbish.\"\n\n\u2022 Rees-Mogg believes that a free trade deal similar to the EU-Canada agreement is the most promising way forward.\n\n\u2022 Barnier is encouraging the UK to backtrack on its promise to come up with a joint plan with Brussels to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u2022 The EU and Eurosceptic MPs are more in agreement than the UK government and Barnier on the issue of a free trade deal.\n\n\u2022 Rees-Mogg has defended Boris Johnson from criticism by suggesting that Downing Street is afraid of him.\u00bb\u00bb",

Katzin and based on the 1972 novel Deathwatch by Robb White. It stars Andy Griffith and Sam Bottoms.\n\nSynopsis\n\nA successful Los Angeles lawyer and hunter, Horton Madec (Andy Griffith), receives a rare permit to hunt bighorn sheep in the nearby Mojave Desert. He hires a timid college student currently working as a filling station attendant named Ben (Sam Bottoms), who will drive him into the desert with his Jeep CJ and help show Madec where the bighorn are. Ben is studying to be a geologist, so therefore he knows the desert very well. After Madec accidentally shoots a ewe with his .30-06 Winchester Model 70 rifle, he buries it and although Ben is disappointed, he agrees that they should pretend like the incident never happened. However, Ben realizes that what Madec shot was no female sheep; upon noting a bloody human hand underneath the grass. Horrified, Ben digs it up and realizes that Madec has actually shot a local prospector named Winnie Haas, who was Ben's friend and mentor. Madec apologizes, but argues that he cannot afford to sit in jail, as he is too important and has a family to take care of. Refusing to cover it up, Ben argues that the honest thing to do would be for the two of them to report the accidental shot, but Madec refuses, even going as far to bribe Ben with thousands of dollars just to keep quiet about the incident. It is then that Madec decides to eliminate the only witness to the crime - Ben. \n\nMadec forces Ben to strip down to nothing but his shorts at gunpoint. He intends to make up a story saying that the two became separated, then Ben went crazy, tore off all his clothes and died within a matter of hours due to dehydration and heat. Ben attempts to escape by walking 45 miles to the nearest highway. Madec watches Ben the entire distance while aiming at him with his rifle. After trying to climb the nearby Big Lizard butte, Ben is shot by Madec, causing him to fall and injure his back. Time is running out as he begins to hallucinate. Suffering from dehydration, hunger, sunburn, and his gunshot wounds, Ben needs to find water, food, shelter, and a weapon. Ben later gets a slingshot from the prospector's tent and uses it to breathe after he buries himself to avoid Madec finding him. Ben eventually uses survival techniques the prospector taught him to locate water inside a cave, later overpowering Madec by lighting his tent on fire, distracting him and allowing him to shoot Madec in the hand with the slingshot. He then drives them back to town and attempts to convince the local police to believe his story; however, Madec's story is more meticulously detailed and convincing to them. Madec claims that Ben shot the prospector after a drunken dispute, backing up his story by stating that he never knew the prospector. As the police cannot find the slingshot, either, they have to go with Madec's story. However, right as Madec is preparing to leave town and filling up with gasoline, there is something lodged in the pump. Ben unclogs it by putting a pole into the underground tank and unearthing the slingshot which Madec had earlier put there and hidden from the police. The local police believe Ben's story and tell Madec to get a lawyer, only for Madec to reply that he is a lawyer. They apologize to Ben for the confusion and Ben replies that he only wanted to report an accident.\n\nCast\n Andy Griffith as Horton Madec\n Sam Bottoms as Ben Campbell\n Noah Beery Jr. as George Whiting\n James Best as Sheriff Bert Hamilton\n Randy Boone as Deputy Dickie Haycroft\n Jim Antonio as Deputy Les Hanford\n James Chandler as The Doctor\n\nProduction\nThe casting of Griffith and Bottoms was announced in June 1974.\n\nReception\nThe Los Angeles Times called the film \"riveting, chilling\".\n\nSee also\n List of American films of 1974\n Beyond the Reach\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nWhat are the themes of the film Savages, and how does it explore the moral dilemmas that hunters may face?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSavages, a 1974 American television thriller film directed by Lee H. Katzin and based on the 1972 novel Deathwatch by Robb White, explores the themes of greed, violence, and survival in the face of unexpected challenges. The film follows Horton Madec, a successful Los Angeles lawyer and hunter who accidentally shoots and kills a local prospector named Winnie Haas in the Mojave Desert. In order to cover up the crime, Madec coerces his assistant Ben into helping him hide the body and frame Ben for the murder. However, Ben refuses to go along with Madec's plan and attempts to escape, leading to a series of dangerous and life-threatening situations. Throughout the film, the audience is presented with a series of moral dilemmas, such as whether or not to lie in order to protect oneself, and the impact of violence on one's character. The film also explores the idea of the \"survival of the fittest\" as Ben is forced to use his knowledge of the desert and his physical strength to outwit and evade Madec. The hunter-turned-prey dynamic in the film also highlights the complex relationship between humans and nature, and the potential for hunters to become the hunted. Ultimately, Savages is a thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of greed and violence, and the human capacity for survival in the face of overwhelming odds.\u00bb\u00bb",

Yagua, as usual, was alert for any dangers to his charges.\n\n\"To become a man,\" Sebastian said when they were on their way again, \"I think you have to master your character and be known as a responsible person.\"\n\nIt was difficult for Arazun\u00fa to understand. Children of his tribe were encouraged to master control of their emotions, and a child who did not do his duties did not share in the food of the tribe. He pressed for more information. \"The pirates called themselves men, yet they acted as fools. Anyone can be a fool. Are there no tests of character to prove yourself? No particular name-days or celebration days when you can look back and say, 'That's the day I became a man'?\"\n\n\"I'd call this journey a test of character,\" laughed Sebastian, \"and if I survive, I'll be glad to call myself a man. Look, why all these questions? What are your traditions?\"\n\n\"When a boy of my tribe reaches manhood, he fasts for several days. Then the shaman comes and etches these scars onto his body. It takes all day long.\"\n\n\"Etches? With what? And doesn't it hurt?\"\n\n\"We do not talk about the pain. The shaman uses a special stone with a sharpened edge. We lose a lot of blood, but when the wounds heal we are men.\"\n\nSebastian was both curious and appalled. He was not sure he would ever allow someone to deliberately use a stone to cut into his body, not even if it were for surgery. \"But how old were you when you became a man?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. It was several seasons ago.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you don't count years?\"\n\nArazun\u00fa shrugged. \"I know what years are, because the pirates tried to teach me, but they are very hard to use.\"\n\nSebastian laughed yet again, delighted to have a conversation partner. He had not realized how desperately lonely he had become. \"They seem easier to use than remembering certain events. Besides, a year is the same for everybody. Seasons and counting by events is only for one person.\"\n\n\"I think my way is easier.\"\n\nSebastian was too happy to argue, especially with the person who had just saved his life.

Arazun\u00fa explained that the shaman etches scars onto the boy's body with a special stone, and they fast for several days. Sebastian was both curious and appalled by this tradition, and he asked Arazun\u00fa how old he was when he became a man. Arazun\u00fa wasn't sure, but he knew it was several seasons ago. Sebastian pointed out that using years as a way to count time was easier than remembering certain events, but Arazun\u00fa disagreed.\n\nAs they continued their journey, Sebastian noticed that the jungle had ended.

Most psychotherapy takes place when a licensed mental health professional and a patient meet one-on-one or with other patients in a group setting.\n\nPsychotherapy can be used as an alternative to or alongside medication and other treatment options. Choosing the right treatment plan should be based on a person's individual needs and medical situation and occur under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n\nEven when medication relieves symptoms, psychotherapy can help a person address specific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking, irrational fears, problems interacting with other people, or difficulty coping with situations at home, school, or work.\n\nTherapists have different professional backgrounds and specialties. This section and the next have information that can help you find out about a therapist\u2019s credentials and find resources for locating therapists.\n\nThe approach a therapist uses depends on the disorder being treated and the training and experience of that therapist. Therapists may combine and adapt elements of different approaches.\n\nOnce you have identified one or more possible therapists, a preliminary conversation can help you understand how treatment will proceed and decide if you feel comfortable with the therapist. Rapport and trust are essential. Discussions in therapy are deeply personal, and it\u2019s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist and have confidence in their expertise.\n\nMany types of professionals offer psychotherapy. Examples include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. Information on providers\u2019 credentials is available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. In addition, you can find resources to help find a therapist on the NIMH's Help for Mental Illnesses webpage.\n\nYour health insurance provider may have a list of mental health professionals participating in your plan. Other resources on the Help for Mental Illnesses webpage can help you look for reduced-cost health services. When talking with a prospective therapist, ask about treatment fees, whether the therapist participates in insurance plans, and whether there is a sliding scale for fees according to income.\n\nYour task is to:\nPull out the different types of mental health professionals mentioned in the article.
