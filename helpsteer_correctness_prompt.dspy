She's fallen down a few times and is worried that she might fall again. She's been to see her doctor, who says she has a condition called vertigo.\n\nKhiry: Doctor, I've been feeling unsteady on my feet lately. I've fallen down a few times and am worried that I might fall again. What can you do to help me?\nDoctor: Well, Khiry, I believe you may have a condition called vertigo. Vertigo is a type of dizziness that is caused by an imbalance in the inner ear. It can be a very bothersome condition, but fortunately there are treatments that can help lessen the symptoms.\nKhiry: Oh, thank goodness! What kind of treatments are available?\nDoctor: There are several options available. One option is vestibular rehabilitation therapy, which is a type of physical therapy specifically designed to help patients with vertigo. This therapy can help improve balance and reduce dizziness by exercises that retrain the brain to process information from the inner ear more effectively. Another option is medication, which can help relieve symptoms by reducing inflammation in the inner ear or by affecting nerve signals that contribute to dizziness. Finally, some patients find relief with surgery, although this is usually only recommended for severe cases that have not responded to other treatments.\nKhiry: Wow, there are quite a few options available! I think I would like to try vestibular rehabilitation therapy first. Can you tell me more about it?\nDoctor: Sure! Vestibular rehabilitation therapy typically consists of a series of exercises specifically designed to retrain the brain to process information from the inner ear more effectively. These exercises often involve moving your head in specific ways while watching an object so that your brain can learn how to properly interpret information from your inner ear and maintain balance even when movement occurs. The therapist will also likely teach you some exercises that you can do at home to continue practicing between sessions. Generally speaking, most people see improvement within 10-12 sessions; however, everyone responds differently so some people may need more or fewer sessions depending on their individual case.\nKhiry: That sounds like it could really help me! How soon can I start?\nDoctor: We can get you set up with an appointment for next week if that works for you?\n\"\"\"\n\nPlease rewrite the text to be more emotional and less formal, as though it were written by Khiry.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abHi there! I'm Khiry, and I'm here to share my story with you. For the last few weeks, I've been feeling unsteady on my feet and have even fallen a few times. It's been really scary, and I've been worried that I might fall again. I decided to go see my doctor, who told me that I might have a condition called vertigo.\n\nAt first, I was a bit scared, but my doctor explained that vertigo is a type of dizziness that is caused by an imbalance in the inner ear. It can be a really bothersome condition, but there are treatments that can help lessen the symptoms. My doctor suggested a few options, including vestibular rehabilitation therapy, medication, and even surgery in severe cases.\n\nVestibular rehabilitation therapy sounds like it could really help me.

The Princess wandered along, sometimes beside Poe, sometimes beside Lenehan. She appeared to be lost in her own thoughts as well.\n\nDagma and Laningrin kept Rullin trussed up and dosed with Ice Poppy syrup. Laningrin had his short sword out and kept it handily pointed at the wizard.\n\nRullin stumbled along, muttering angry words under his breath, looking a little green.\n\n'What is he saying, Lan?' Daniel asked, feeling confident about addressing his friend more casually.\n\nThe ranger leaned closer to the wizard.\n\n'He appears to be repeatedly asking why 'He' (whoever He is) would burn him out,' Laningrin replied. 'Also, he is making all kinds of interesting threats. Perhaps we should have allowed Fireforge to take him back?'\n\n'No, I don't want him out of my sight.' Rishana shook her head, overhearing the conversation. 'He's too slippery and Fireforge could not keep him dosed with poppy. It's safer to have him with us, as strange as that sounds.'\n\nDaniel shuddered. Having Rullin so close didn't feel safe at all.\n\nPoe had attempted to dispel the magic that bound Daniel to Rullin, but he conceded that he couldn't completely remove it. While Daniels' arm no longer ached or burned, it still felt unclean in some way. Looking at Rullin made it prickle, even though the wizard was apparently now harmless.\n\nIt took them a couple of hours to clear the forest. Daniel felt lighter as soon as they left the looming trees behind. His legs felt weary, but with Nilofar back on his shoulders, humming to himself, everything was as it should be.\n\nLenehan called a halt.\n\n'Dust ahead - I'd say the royal guards are on their way.' She smiled.\n\n'Good old Fireforge,' Laningrin whooped. 'He's sent them this way.' He slapped Daniel heartily on the back, making him stumble.\n\n'Well, lad, not far for you now. You'll be able to ride back in style.'\n\nDaniel bit his lip. Now would be a good time to admit he had no idea how to ride a horse. But how hard could it be? He'd willingly forgotten how uncomfortable riding Mull had been and how easily the donkey had managed to discard him.\n\nAs they waited, the smudge on the horizon came into focus. Thirty horsemen, in brightly coloured tunics under burnished armour, with lances and swords, bows, arrows and knives all stashed about their persons.\n\nThe horses were solid warriors, with thick muscles and feathery hair on their legs in the likeness of a draught horse. Only, they appeared lighter on their hooves.\n\n'What are those?' Daniel squeaked.\n\n'They are the heavy cavalry. See the smaller ones behind the first row? The light cavalry are far speedier, but not as sturdy,' Nilofar informed him.\n\nWhen the cavalry pulled up in front of the companions, Daniel could make out the difference. Twenty horsemen sat upon the heavy chargers while ten more danced around the outside, whirling their lighter horses around the perimeter.\n\nThere were also pack horses and a series of horses tethered together, which Daniel assumed were for the rangers to take back with them.\n\nThe captain of the guard stayed in the saddle, but bowed from his waist, frowning at Rishana. He had been concerned about having to explain to the Queen how he'd lost her daughter and whilst relieved to see her safe, was a little upset with her for making him worry.\n\n'Your Highness, the Queen sends you her birthday wishes. She is very concerned that you did not locate the sceptre in time for your ceremony. We ran into some of her Royal Guard whilst we were out looking for you.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text given, extract how the people in the group felt about the wizard.

It begins when a female bee lays an egg in a hexagonal cell in the hive and then seals it with a thin film of wax. The sealed cell serves as a nursery for the developing larva. When the egg hatches, the larva is fed with a mixture of pollen and honey called \"bee bread.\" After several days, the larva spins a cocoon around itself and enters the pupal stage. During this stage, the bee undergoes metamorphosis and develops its adult form. After about two weeks, the adult bee emerges from the cocoon and starts its life as a worker bee.\n\nAs a worker bee, its primary task is to collect pollen and nectar from flowers to bring back to the hive. The bee uses its long, barbed tongue to gather nectar and then stores it in its crop, a sac in its throat that can hold up to 70 times its body weight. When the bee returns to the hive, it passes the nectar to other worker bees, who extract the honey and store it in the honeycombs.\n\nIn addition to collecting food, worker bees also perform other essential tasks in the hive, such as building and maintaining the wax structures, guarding the entrance, and tending to the queen bee. The queen bee is the only female bee in the hive that can lay eggs. She is typically much larger than the worker bees and has a longer lifespan, up to five years compared to the worker bees' average lifespan of six weeks.\n\nThe life of a bee is truly fascinating, from its humble beginnings as an egg to its role as a worker bee, ensuring the survival of its colony.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abgiven this background information\n<start of reference>\nShould We Fear the Bird Dragon? Mythological and legendary creatures come in all shapes and sizes.  Sometimes they resemble us, humans, but oftentimes, they are hybrid beasts whose existence brings about both fascination and fear. Just take a look at the Minotaur. Or griffins. Even unicorns! But there\u2019s a dragon-like \u2014 sometimes, serpent-like \u2014 creature that holds arguably two identities to its name.  It is the Cockatrice.  Also known as the Basilisk, by some.  A type of chimera that had people confused since its first mention around the late 14th century.  But what was the fuss all about?  What is the Cockatrice? One of the earliest appearances of the word cockatrice can be traced to a passage in the Bible, under Isaiah chapter 11. However, that mention didn\u2019t provide much detail as to what the Cockatrice really is.  In fact, our current knowledge of this mystical beast was only formed during the 14th century.  A small, two-legged dragon with a rooster\u2019s head that has the power to easily destroy anyone that catches its gaze.  The name Cockatrice was from a late Middle English word, derived from Old French cocatris \u2014 a cognate of the Greek ichneumon and the medieval Latin calcatrix, meaning \u201ctracker\u201c.  According to the lore, the Cockatrice is a creature made of pure poison that even a single glance from it can immediately cause death. That is because its eyes have the ability to turn its victim into stone \u2014 just like the Gorgon Medusa. \u201cThe death-darting eye of Cockatrice\u201c, as they call it. Another lethal thing about this creature is its saliva, which \u2014 accounts say \u2014 can take down animals regardless of the size. Similarly, the breath and touch of the Cockatrice can end any life form that comes close to it. Of course, except for weasels. The legend has it that the weasel is the \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Cockatrice. Weasels are said to secrete a venom, deadly to the monster. And so, for a very long time, people believed that carrying this small mammal would keep the Cockatrice away. Over time, more elements had been added to the story. This explains why at the beginning of the 17th century, the cock was also considered to be a foe to the forbidding creature.  Accounts say that upon hearing a rooster crow, the Cockatrice would die straight away. But if you aren\u2019t lucky enough to spot a rooster or a weasel prior to your battle with the Cockatrice \u2014 if that ever weirdly happens to you \u2014 then know that a mirror would likely be enough to do the thing. Just make the mythological beast look at its own reflection! It\u2019s believed to be one of the few sure-fire ways to defeat the ferocious Cockatrice. These fatal weaknesses of the Cockatrice \u2014 the weasel, the cock, and the mirror \u2014 are all shared with the Basilisk. And that is just scratching the tip of the Cockatrice-Basilisk iceberg. Untangling the Confusion Between the Cockatrice and the Basilisk If the Cockatrice is known for its dragon and birdlike features, the Basilisk bears more resemblance to serpents. This is what generally differentiates the two. But when and how exactly did the lines between them begin to blur? Try to read about the Basilisk online or in books and you\u2019ll find out that the Cockatrice is known as either its cousin, a mythological being similar to it, or even just another one of its names.  How come? Well, let\u2019s look at the recorded description of the serpentine monster.  For starters, the Basilisk dates back to a far earlier time than the Cockatrice\u2019s emergence in stories and written accounts, alike.  First mentioned in the 1st century by the Roman poet, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus \u2014 better known as Lucan \u2014 the Basilisk is notorious for its death-causing glance and its highly poisonous body. Sounds familiar? Well, try to remember its weaknesses which were mentioned earlier.  And there\u2019s still more to it!  The Basilisk got its name from its Greek form basil\u00edskos \u2014 meaning \u201clittle king\u201c. Because of this, artists and scribes from ancient times often depicted the \u201cking of the serpents\u201d as a snake-lizard hybrid, occasionally with dragon wings, and usually wearing a crown. Sometimes, this crown is replaced with \u201ca white spot on the head\u201d which \u2014 frankly \u2014 still looks like a diadem.  But as time goes by, artists more frequently started to take the liberty in illustrating the Basilisk \u2014 ultimately repainting its crown as a part of its body in the form of a crown-shaped crest.  Much like that of a rooster.  And which mythical creature has something like that?  Right, the Cockatrice!   Line art drawing of a heraldic cockatrice. Some modern experts and researchers believe that this specific change in the depiction of the Basilisk paved the way for the eventual birth of the Cockatrice in the late 14th century.  A possible reason why the two have a lot of things in common.  Still, others prefer to hold on to the theory that the Cockatrice and the Basilisk are two separate types of monsters.  With one of their main arguments being, in the modern-day sense, a tigon and a liger remain distinct from each other \u2014 regardless of how similar they may seem to be.  Whether or not they actually are different, though, is something I\u2019ll leave for you to decide.  Is the Cockatrice Real? Until around the 1700s, people maintained the belief that the Cockatrice exists in \u2014 at least \u2014 some parts of the world.  In present times, however, a more favorable explanation for the accounts, revolving around the Cockatrice, is that while the sightings may have been true, what they saw probably was something else.  Something that can be explained by science. Take, for example, cobras. These venomous snakes can maintain an upright posture, standing as tall as a third of their body length whenever they feel threatened, when they\u2019re searching for food, or when they\u2019re preparing to attack.  This could explain why accounts often described the Cockatrice as a reptilian monster that stands on two legs. If so, one of the plausible zoological origins of the Cockatrice would be the Egyptian cobra, which lives in the desert and was revered by the ancient Egyptians as a symbol of royalty.  An allusion to the crown-shaped crest, perhaps? The Cockatrice truly is a force to be reckoned with.  That even centuries after its dawn, it still is causing debates among people.  And while other species of snakes could also pass as the scientific culprit in the rise of this legendary beast, not everyone is convinced.  Therefore, leaving the centuries-old puzzle that is the Cockatrice unsolved even up to this modern day.\n<end of reference>\nPlease use the text directly and create an analysis that highlights the key points about the Cockatrice and its relationship with the Basilisk.
