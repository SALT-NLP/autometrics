Tuberculosis (TB), induced by the foxy Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is still one of the top killers worldwide among infectious diseases. Although several antibiotics have been developed to significantly relieve the tuberculosis epidemics worldwide, there are still several important scientific challenges for tuberculosis. As one of the most critical issues for tuberculosis control, the accurate and timely diagnosis of tuberculosis is critical for the following therapy of tuberculosis and is thus responsible for the effective control of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Current tuberculosis diagnostic methods in clinics are still facing the difficulty that they can\u2019t provide rapid diagnostic results with high sensitivity and accuracy, which therefore requires the development of more effective novel diagnostic strategies. In recent decades, nanomaterials have been proven to show promising potential for novel nano biosensor construction based on their outstanding physical, chemical, and biological properties. Taking these promising advantages, nanomaterial-based biosensors show the potential to allow rapid, sensitive, and accurate tuberculosis diagnosis. Here, aiming to increase the development of a more effective tuberculosis diagnostic strategy, we summarized the current progress of nano biosensors for potential tuberculosis diagnosis applications. We discussed the different kinds of diagnostic targets for tuberculosis diagnosis based on nano biosensors, ranging from the detection of bacterial components from M. tuberculosis, such as DNA and proteins, to the host immunological responses, such as specific cytokine production, and to the direct whole cell detection of M. tuberculosis. We believe that this review would enhance our understanding of nano biosensors for potential tuberculosis diagnosis, and further promote future research on nano biosensor-based tuberculosis diagnosis to benefit the more effective control of tuberculosis epidemic.\n\nYour task is to:\nCan you help me choose a few options for an appropriate title that gives the main idea of the article?

Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy that is available in federal and state courts in the United States. An injunction is useful in resolving legal disputes by providing a party with a remedy that is tailored to their specific situation. Injunctive relief can be used to protect a party's rights, prevent irreparable harm, or ensure that a contract is performed. There are several types of injunctions, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions. The decision to grant an injunction is based on a number of factors, including the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits of their case, the harm that the plaintiff will suffer if the injunction is not granted, and the harm that the defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted.\u00bb\u00bb",

The mess that was my life was a result of many factors. Some of them were problems for my parents that later affected me and also problems within our family. Since my parents were still new in this country they needed to get jobs that would allow them to support themselves and also this meant that they had to be away for long amounts of time. This resulted in me having to take preschool twice. Since they were busy, and I could not go with them I needed a place to stay so preschool was a simple solution that allowed them to work while not having to worry if I was ok or not. When I started elementarily I had to move frequently because they moved around a lot for their jobs and in addition, we also moved homes frequently so I had to switch schools in order to make their lives a little easier. However, entering middle school they began to settle down which let me stay in a middle school all four years. My middle school years were also the years where I began to see conflicts that I had been oblivious to previously. I began to see how they would fight with frequency over many things, and I also began to notice how my dad had a tendency to drink away his worries. I noticed this and it was hard to not see it because these times were the times when he would be the most aggressive or when he would be the least approachable. When this happened, I had an overwhelming sense of uselessness and would do anything possible to avoid him. However, I had to depend on him to take me.\nSince I was young my life has been a bit of a mess with no order at all, but there was one that I knew was clear, and this was that my family was the one thing I could always go back to.

I noticed this and it was hard to not see it because during these times were the times when he would be the most aggressive or when he would be the least approachable. When this happened, I had an overwhelming sense of uselessness and would do anything possible to avoid him. However, I had to depend on him to take me to school every day so could never avoid him and this was a major problem for me because I didn\u2019t want to be fully dependent on him. Later on when I was in the 8th or 9th grade I began to talk back to my father and began to argue with him frequently. I had finally gained the courage to talk back and talk against what he was doing, however this just led to a rise in arguments and also led to a greater tear in our relationship. Current events are also affecting us today. We have been affected by a new law that might go into place, and if it does it has the capacity to tear us apart.

A total lunar eclipse takes place when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and its shadow covers the Moon. Eclipse watchers can see the Moon turn red when the eclipse reaches totality. Total eclipses of the Moon happen at Full Moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned to form a line. The astronomical term for this type of alignment is syzygy, which comes from the Greek word for being paired together. The Moon does not have its own light but shines because its surface reflects the Sun's rays. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and blocks any direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. The Sun casts the Earth's shadow on the Moon's surface. A shallow total eclipse saw the Moon in relative darkness for 49 minutes and 29.5 seconds. The Moon was 9.503% of its diameter into the Earth's umbral shadow, and should have been significantly darkened. The partial eclipse lasted for 3 hours, 35 minutes and 22.9 seconds in total.\n\nEclipse season\nThis event followed the total solar eclipse of May 9, 1910.\n\nVisibility\nIt was completely visible over Australia, the Americas, Europe and Africa, seen rising over Australia and setting over Europe and Africa.\n\nRelated lunar eclipses\n\nSaros series\n\nIt last occurred on May 11, 1892 and will next occur on June 3, 1928.\n\nThis is the 32nd member of Lunar Saros 129, and the first total eclipse. The next event is the June 1928 lunar eclipse. Lunar Saros 129 contains 11 total lunar eclipses between 1910 and 2090. Solar Saros 136 interleaves with this lunar saros with an event occurring every 9 years 5 days alternating between each saros series.\n\nInex series\n\nHalf-Saros cycle\nA lunar eclipse will be preceded and followed by solar eclipses by 9 years and 5.5 days (a half saros).
