The remaining two passengers \u2014 ages 17 and 15 \u2014 were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, but they were both pronounced dead a short time later.\n\nA preliminary investigation carried out by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol revealed the Chevy stopped behind another vehicle at the traffic sign but did not come to a full stop before it entered the intersection. The National Transportation and Safety Board on Thursday, citing witness accounts, confirmed the vehicle came to a \"rolling stop\" before the deadly collision.\n\nIn this image provided by KFOR-TV, a heavily damaged vehicle is seen off a road in Tishomingo, Okla., following a two-vehicle collision in which six teenage students were killed, Tuesday, March 22, 2022. (AP)\n\nThe southbound semitrailer then struck the front left side of the hatchback, carrying the girls eastbound, the impact of which sent both vehicles flying off the roadway, according to the NTSB.\n\n\"Our prayers are with each of the families involved and our community,\" the Johnston County Oklahoma Sheriff's Office said on Facebook in wake of the tragedy. \"This is an absolute tragedy which will have life long effects. This community and families need our support and prayers at this time.\n\nThe Highway Patrol identified the driver of the truck as 51-yaer-old Valendon Burton of Burneyville, Okla. He was not injured in the incident.\n\nBoth the NTSB and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol's Traffic Homicide Unit continue to investigate.\n\"\"\"\n\nRewrite the text to be more emotional and less factual, as though it were written by a grieving teacher.\n\nYesterday, my students and I were out for lunch when we witnessed a horrible collision. Our car was stopped at a stop sign when a massive truck ran into us at full speed. My students and I were all thrown against the dashboard and windows, and I was the only one to survive.\n\nThe truck driver did not see us at the stop sign and did not even attempt to slow down or change course. The impact was so great that it sent our car flying off the road and into a ditch. My students were all killed instantly, and I am devastated.\n\nI am grieving for my students, who were all so young and had so much potential. They were all members of our school choir and had such beautiful voices. They were my friends and my family, and I will miss them terribly.\n\nThis tragedy has affected our whole community, and we are all grieving together. We are praying for the families of my students and for the truck driver, who is also suffering.\n\nI am grateful to be alive, but I feel so lost without my students. I hope that someday, I can find the strength to move on and continue to make them proud.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abHello\u00bb\u00bb",

Roots and Dore will kick off the free series, which will then move to Thursdays starting at 7 p.m. April 1.\n\nUp to 15 acts have been scheduled for the series, said Mike Clary, director of community development for the city.\n\nThe series was established last year as a way to present music during the pandemic, he said. The goals for Jammin' in the Alley, like all city events, are to create activity within the city, which will have a positive economic impact and improve the quality of life for residents.\n\nRiyen Roots and Kenny Dore (pronounced Doe Ray as in \"do re me fa so la ti do\") are not strangers to Abbeville. They performed at the Hogs &amp; Hens Festival last fall.\n\nThe Asheville, N.C.-based duo was hired to do the festival and it went over well. \"It seems like we're getting a lot of love down in that area,\" Roots said. \"We're gonna have a really good time. I would like to give thanks to Mike Elis of Artisan Entertainment for bringing us down there.\"\n\nThe duo specializes in original acoustic-based blues and soul and Americana music. Its inspiration is 100 years of American roots music, Roots said. The group features music by Robert Johnson, the Allman Brothers, Johnny Cash and Carter family tunes. Mostly it's all blues-based.\n\n\"He (Roots) and Dore are one of the most talented duos in the Carolinas. Their music is absolute gold,\" said Elis, who is the CEO of Artisan Entertainment. He met the group around three years ago after it opened a show in Hendersonville, N.C. \"Roots is a master of the old Memphis blues.\"\n\nIt's why they are both blues icons in the Asheville area, Elis said. \"If people visit, they will be treated to a great day of music.\"\n\nThe duo performs up to 200 shows a year and can play for any audience. \"I always say we've never met an audience we couldn't make happy,\" said Roots, who plays the guitar while Dore plays the harmonica. When a third member is added, the group is called the Dore Band. \"I've always been told I'm like a large Swiss Army knife of music.\"\n\nRoots' favorite music includes Sam Cooke and Otis Redding tunes; he is a huge fan of Johnny Cash and Blaze Foley (a country music singer and songwriter). As far as blues, his favorite musicians are Blind Willie Johnson, BB King and Robert Johnson.\n\nA proud moment for Roots is when he met King, who gave him some practical advice. King told me \"To treat every show as though it's the biggest show of my life whether it's 3 or 300 people. That's been the secret to my relative success.\"\n\nRoots assesses success by watching how the audience is interacting, getting them dancing or clapping or most important, people approaching them and saying, \"Thanks so much, I needed that.\"\n\nJohnny Lee Hooker once said \"Music is a healer,\" Roots recalled. \"I think blues is a healing music that is needed. That's another reason we're out and about.\"\n\nGiven the pandemic, a lot of healing is needed. COVID-19 has been a tedious time, to say the least, Roots said.\n\nMost of their shows are performed in a 90-mile radius of Asheville, what Roots calls \"our daily bread shows.\" The group also goes to New Orleans once a year, although COVID-19 has slowed down travel.\n\n\"It's not easy to be a traveling musician, but we're fortunate enough to find venues that have social distance rules and large open zones. It looks like things are starting to bounce back a little bit. I definitely see it getting busier, especially with the weathering improving.\"\n\nThe band has about 12 breweries in a 90-mile radius that it plays consistently, Roots said, adding that he jokingly says: \"Blues and brews, you can't lose.\" If there is barbecue there, that's a plus.\n\n\"In my experience, I host two weekly open mics in Asheville and Black Mountain, N.C., and that's to provide some consistency for artists who emotionally, very much need to get out and perform,\" Roots said.\n\nA lot of venues have opened up even with limited seating, Elis said. That's why it is important for people to support local musicians.\n\n\"We lost a lot of that for so long,\" he said. \"My advice is to come out, enjoy a drink and a meal and enjoy the music.\"\n\nPeople also should support local businesses like Belmont. They go out of their way to bring entertainment to the city, Elis said.\n\nWhile masking and social distancing are encouraged, Clary said masks are not required to attend the concert.\n\nYour task is to:\nWhich music genre is the most prominent in the text?

I\u2019m trying to figure out if my country, the United States, is really a \u201cland of opportunity\u201d, or if it\u2019s really just for a select few.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abEquality is a concept that is used to describe a state of being where all individuals or groups are treated equally, without discrimination or bias. Equality can be defined in various ways, depending on the context in which it is being used. In general, it refers to the idea that everyone should have equal access to resources, opportunities, and rights, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic that may be used to discriminate against them.\n\nThe United States is a diverse country with a history of discrimination and inequality. While the United States has made progress towards becoming a more equal society, there is still work to be done to achieve true equality for all. Some argue that the United States is a land of opportunity, where anyone can succeed if they work hard enough. Others argue that the United States is still dominated by a small group of wealthy and powerful individuals, and that true equality is a distant dream.\n\nIn order to answer this question, it is important to consider various factors such as income inequality, access to education and healthcare, and representation in politics and the workforce. It is also important to acknowledge the ongoing challenges and barriers faced by marginalized communities in the United States, such as racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.\n\nOverall, while the United States has made progress towards becoming a more equal society, there is still work to be done to achieve true equality for all.\u00bb\u00bb",

Over uplifting guitar riffs, Joy sings in the chorus: \u201cBecause when I\u2019m in a room with you, that missing piece is found \/ You know when you\u2019re by my side, darling, nothing can break us down.\u201d Beyond soundtracking Dr. Avery\u2019s goodbye, the song also mirrors the relationship between him and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), who agreed to move with Dr. Avery to Boston in the previous episode.\n\nIndeed, love is at the core of \u201cMissing Piece.\u201d Joy, who had a huge hit in 2013 with \u201cRiptide,\u201d tells Variety that he wrote the new single a year ago while quarantining in his hometown of Melbourne, Australia \u2014 separated from his girlfriend, who lives in Spain.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people were separated [during that time], and travel was difficult and still is,\u201d Joy says. \u201cIt\u2019s a song about wanting to see and be with someone, but also the feeling of not being too fazed.

Within the upcoming release, some stand-out pieces include a white tee stamped with the 1998 title Wild Things ($100), a teal-colored 1972 Academy Awards baseball cap ($55), a blue and yellow Blockbuster duffle bag ($60), a silk Armani scarf printed with the face of legendary film director Martine Scorcese ($85), and a beach towel with a still from the 1994 hit film Reality Bites ($80).\n\nCourtesy of A24\n\nBijan Shahvali, founder of Intramural Shop, sourced the coveted pieces from all over the globe, in addition to pulling items from his own personal collection and of friends within his vintage network. \"I was thrilled when A24 reached out because I think they really embody all the things I love about film,\" Shahvali exclusively told NYLON in an official statement. \"My goal for this curation was to celebrate all the different aspects of the film experience that we are all nostalgic for \u2014 the blockbusters, the arthouse, theatre, the emergence of cable television, and everything in between \u2014 while still feeling very much like A24. I also wanted the collection to be something film buffs and filmmakers alike would get a kick out of.\"\n\nGift the movie lover in your life for the holidays or add onto your own merch collection with items from A24 x Intramural Shop's vintage merch drop, available to shop starting on Wednesday, Dec. 1, on A24films.com.\n\nInstruction:\nWhat are some of the most notable items in the vintage merchandise collection, and what are the films they are inspired by?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSome of the most notable items in the vintage merchandise collection include a white tee stamped with the 1998 title Wild Things ($100), a teal-colored 1972 Academy Awards baseball cap ($55), a blue and yellow Blockbuster duffle bag ($60), a silk Armani scarf printed with the face of legendary film director Martine Scorcese ($85), and a beach towel with a still from the 1994 hit film Reality Bites ($80).
