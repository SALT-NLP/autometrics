The opinions expressed are their own.)\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's flagging economy is causing people to drown their sorrows. That's fine by Kweichow Moutai, the country's largest maker of baijiu, the national firewater. The $332 billion distiller reported a 24% net profit jump in the first quarter as sales touched 33 billion yuan ($5 billion). It's an historical record, per Refinitiv data, accompanied by solid progress on its initiative to boost margins by cutting out middlemen. Direct sales contributed a third of revenue, twice as much as a year earlier.\n\nAlready trading at more than 30 times expected earnings for the coming year, it's an expensive stock compared to peers. And if China's draconian lockdowns persist, it'll be harder for thirsty customers to buy its products. Moutai has lost 15% of its market value over the last 12 months, even as it outperformed benchmarks. Chinese indexes are some of the worst-performing in the world outside Russia. With a mouth-watering profit margin over 50% and an amusing Twitter presence, the largest listed company inside the country will be a preferred trader tipple.\n\nFollow @Breakingviews https:\/\/twitter.com\/Breakingviews on Twitter\n\nCapital Calls - More concise insights on global finance:\n\nFreight rate bonanza offers Maersk M&amp;A ticket\n\nBritain's beefed-up M&amp;A watchdog\n\nBBVA's Turkish M&amp;A bump pleases all parties\n\nChina's yuan jerkily adjusts to ugly reality\n\nGap falls through the inflation gap\n\n(Editing by Jeffrey Goldfarb and Katrina Hamlin)\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nTrending Topics\n\nTrending Articles\n\nLatest Markets Videos\n\nReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world's largest international multimedia news provider reaching more than one billion people every day.

I just felt that Connie and the other kids should know.\"\n\n\"You told other kids too?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Which ones?\"\n\nI hesitated before answering. Was she friends with Sudsy's mother too?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nI sighed. This older kid named Sudsy and these two boys who \u2013 \"\n\nMrs. Carasco rolled her eyes. \"Great. The biggest troublemaker on the block knows your secret now.\" Shaking her head in exasperation, she started to close the door. \"Go to sleep.\"\n\nMy timing was terrible, but I chose that moment to try to talk to her about Pearl. \"Wait,\" I said. \"That kid Sudsy, his little sister Pearl is being abused \u2013 abused the same way my sister was.\"\n\nMrs. Carasco was just as skeptical as Mrs. Burgess. \"And just how do you know this?\"\n\n\"I saw a big bruise on her arm. And she acts really scared all the time, just like \u2013 \"\n\n\"She probably just got some discipline. And if she's anything like that brother of hers, I'm sure she deserved it.\"\n\n\"And another thing,\" I continued. \"I've seen Sudsy hit her. My brothers used to hit my sister too, because they knew they could get away with it.\"\n\n\"That girl is none of your business. You just worry about yourself. Now go to sleep.\"\n\nMrs. Carasco left, closing the door behind her so I could change. Defeated, I changed into my pajamas, climbed into bed, and turned off the lights. I left the door closed.\n\nThat night I had another nightmare about you.\n\nI was walking along a dirt road with shrubs and trees on both sides, a country road or a road in a really big park. The trees were tall, but not tall enough or close enough to the road to block out the sun. I turned a bend in the road and all of a sudden I saw you walking far ahead of me. I called out your name but you kept on walking. I ran to catch up with you and called your name again, but you still kept walking. Finally, when I was only a few yards away from you, you turned around and raised a hand like a traffic cop and shouted \"Stop!\".\n\n\"What?\" I cried.\n\n\"It's too late!\" You shouted. \"Just go away!\"\n\nI asked you what you meant by 'it's too late'. You said \"I'm dead. It's too late to be nice to me, so don't even try.\" I said \"It's not too late!\" And you said \"Yes it is! And it's too late for you to help Pearl too!\" As soon as you mentioned Pearl one of the sleeves of the blouse you were wearing caught fire. You slapped at it but the fire didn't go out. Then your other sleeve caught fire, and then your hair. \"It's too late!\" you shouted again.\n\nThat's when I woke up. Gasping, I sat up in bed, drew my knees up to my chest and started to cry. Covering my face with my bedsheet to stifle my sobs, I struggled to pull myself together. I wasn't quite there yet when Ian knocked gently on the door.\n\n\"Mara, are you okay?\" he asked.\n\nI coughed a few times to clear my throat. \"Yeah,\" I croaked. \"Go away.\"\n\nHe didn't hear me.\n\n\"Mara?\n\nWhat is the style of writing in this excerpt?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThis excerpt uses a personal, diary-like style.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\n<start of reference>\nSchool spirit is in many ways the heart of a school. Pride is a school spirit synonym because it helps foster a sense of belonging among students and staff who are part of the school. It is often a direct reflection of a school\u2019s culture, which can serve as a powerful influence on overall academic performance. A strong sense of school spirit makes staff and students feel more invested in their school, which makes them happier and motivates them to work harder and help each other out. Schools at every level can improve their culture and performance by actively promoting school spirit on their campus.\n\nWhat Is School Spirit?\nWhen it\u2019s at its strongest, school spirit inspires active participation in school activities and events. While most people associate school spirit with high attendance for pep rallies and athletic events, it also involves joining school clubs and participating in all kinds of extracurricular activities. Uniforms and club shirts serve as a form of spirit wear, meaning that following a dress code helps promote a sense of belonging to the school family. Positive relationships between staff and students foster a strong sense of school spirit. Many schools host annual spirit weeks where everyone is encouraged to dress up according to a predetermined theme.\n\nSignificance of School Pride\nWhen people take pride in something, they tend to work harder and feel more invested than they would without that sense of pride. For better or worse, school spirit is contagious. Students and staff who show enthusiasm for being a part of the school are likely to encourage their peers to follow suit, which yields greater participation in school activities and boosts both morale and performance. Since the opposite also holds true, though, students and staff who exhibit disdain or apathy toward their role in the school can have detrimental effects on morale and performance. Schools with a stronger sense of pride and spirit typically outperform their competition in both athletic and academic arenas.\n\nWhat Does School Spirit Look Like?\nSchool spirit looks like teamwork. It involves events and activities that bring members of the school community together in some way. In addition to its positive impact on morale and performance, school spirit is generally fun. It celebrates successes and creates a sense of togetherness. From colorful posters reflecting schoolwide goals to award ceremonies, special events and team-building activities, school spirit looks like a community of learners and educators working together for the greater good.\n\nSchool Spirit at the Elementary Level\nFor students at the primary level, fun is the name of the school spirit game. One simple way to have fun while showing school spirit is to schedule dress-up days based on a common theme. Students can come to school in their most comfortable pajamas for pajama day, or they can dress up like their favorite storybook character. Pep rallies are another way for elementary schools to dial up the fun and the sense of pride. During the pep rally, schools can play lively music and even make their own songs to sing about their community. Games make another great component to pep rallies. Students can be randomly selected to represent each grade level and then compete in a variety of games while the school cheers them on. Movie nights to promote family involvement can also be useful school spirit events.\n\nSchool Spirit at the Secondary Level\nJust like their elementary counterparts, secondary schools can also benefit from hosting themed dress-up days and lively pep rallies or spirit assemblies. Schools can line the hallways with exceptional examples of student work and creativity. Field days and teacher vs. student athletic competitions are fun ways to fuel school spirit and team building. A school talent show can increase school spirit by giving community members a chance to shine while doing what they do best. Secondary schools can also host themed dances where students can let loose and show off their best dance moves.\n\nSchool Spirit at the Postsecondary Level\nSchool spirit is just as important in higher education as it is in the lower levels. From museum nights to theater performances and sports competitions, colleges and universities have no shortage of ways to boost their school spirit. Making and selling spirit wear that reflects the school\u2019s sports teams is also a useful way to promote a sense of pride at the postsecondary level.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nYou are an elementary student who loves school, and you are interested in acquiring some school spirit. What are some ways you can participate in the school spirit? Select at least three options below:\n1. Join a dress-up day based on a common theme.\n2. Participate in pajama day and wear your best pajamas.\n3. Cheers at the pep rallies.\n4. Come to school movie nights.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abDress up days and pep rallies are the most common and enjoyable school spirit activities. Joining these activities helps foster a sense of belonging to the school community. Also, dressing up in different ways, especially as your favorite character, helps increase your self-esteem. Moreover, it is always interesting to participate in games and activities organized by the school, as it promotes teamwork, healthy competition, and a sense of pride in being part of the school community.\u00bb\u00bb",

It renews an earlier agreement signed between the two parties in 1983 which focused on implementing programmes designed to reverse the impact of brain drain in developing countries like Somalia.\n\nThirty-six years later, IOM's programme footprint has grown in Somalia. With over 450 staff across six regions of the country, IOM has been providing life-saving humanitarian services to crisis-affected populations, promoting durable solutions to displacement for IDPs and returnees, and supporting community stabilization and early recovery activities, while steadily supporting programmes related to long-term recovery and migration governance and development.\n\nThe recently launched Mission Strategy 2019 \u2013 2021 is a testament to IOM's commitment to working closely and strengthening its partnership with the Government of Somalia in line with the country's National Development Plan.\n\nMinister Hassan highlighted the need for a closer cooperation between IOM and the Government and thanked the organization for its commitment to supporting Somalia and its people. \"The renewal of the cooperation agreement signifies the milestone thus far and reaffirms IOM's commitment to work jointly on migration related issues,\" Minister Hassan stated.\n\nFor his part, Abdiker highlighted the significant gains the Government and the people of Somalia have achieved over the past decade. He stressed the readiness of IOM to support the Government in achieving its development goals, including its commitments to SDGs and the Global Compact for Migration.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nWhat is the significance of this agreement in terms of IOM's support of development goals and migration-related issues in Somalia?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe agreement signed between IOM and the Federal Government of Somalia underlines their mutual interest in strengthening cooperation and working together on migration issues to promote economic and social development.
