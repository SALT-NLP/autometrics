I'm excited to get started.\nJanina: Excellent. So, why don't we start by telling me a little bit about your experience?\nPerson: Absolutely. I've been working in customer service for about 4 years now, and I have to say that it's something I'm really passionate about. I love helping people, and I feel like I have a lot of patience. In my previous job, I was often praised by my manager for being able to diffusing difficult situations.\nJanina: That sounds great. We're really looking for someone who is patient and good at diffusing difficult situations.\nPerson: Yes, definitely. I understand how important it is to provide excellent customer service, and I'm confident that I can do that here.\nJanina: Excellent. We'll definitely keep that in mind. So, what do you think makes you stand out from the other candidates?\nPerson: Well, one of the things that makes me stand out the most is my attention to detail. In my previous job, we would often have to deal with irate customers who would call in about their orders being wrong or not received on time. And more often than not, it would turn out that the issue was due to a simple mistake that could have easily been avoided if someone had just paid more attention to detail. So, ever since then, paying close attention to detail has become very important to me.\nJanina: That's definitely something we value here as well\\. Mistakes can be costly, so we need someone who is detail-oriented and will double check their work before moving on\\.\nPerson: Absolutely\\.

Again, the image of the brow Chakra is repeated as the difficult throat Chakra is revealed. See how preparatory images of the heart Chakra appear as echoes of other disclosures.\n\nThe order of disclosure is meaningful. First the Kundalini, the energies of the Chakras, then the first Chakra, then the guardian brow Chakra. Next the Chakra of wrath is revealed before the obscure throat Chakra, then the hidden sacral plexus Chakra, whose hexagram structure is echoed in aspects of the throat Chakra itself. Then comes the heart Chakra after much preparation, then finally the crown Chakra, the Cosmos itself.\n\nI did not notice the second feature until twenty months after the meditations! Learning from experience is surely a lengthy process.\n\nIn the last meditation the top three Chakras are linked in a composite structure. Now, look at my version of the base Chakra, the chalice-like bowl and host above it. Can you see the throat Chakra in the base and armature? See the brow Chakra stripped of its petals\/wings in the globe and see the remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.\n\nI believe there is a great mystery in this coincidence of forms.\n\nNow notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme. Notice also how unique each of these forms is. Both are very active Chakras \u2013 both are _living_ Chakras. I believe that we, as human beings, have made these Chakras. I believe it is these Chakras that are to be transformed into the higher natures. See that the heart Chakra, the Chakra of the transforming Ego, has already begun this process in the throat Chakra.\n\n9\/9\/99\n\nThe Spiritual Organs\n\nTHE SPIRITUAL BODY\n\nInitiation is nothing other than man's gaining the capacity of developing organs of vision in his higher bodies.\n\nRudolf Steiner, _Egyptian Myths and Mysteries_.\n\nI want here to extend the scheme laid out in my last essay on the Spiritual Organs. You will find that the means used to gain this new knowledge differs significantly from that used in my previous essay. There, if you remember, disclosure was by and large involuntary and complete in every instance \u2013 I mean that the images revealed were complete in themselves, even though they might be extended or augmented at a later stage by other images. Here, as you will see, knowledge is gained in a more piecemeal way, often by simply studying familiar schemes in a new light. And while an overall pattern will emerge, many details will remain hidden, awaiting future investigation.\n\nThese very different spiritual experiences arise because they are received by different parts of our being. Characterising these experiences as image-concept and form-presence, we can pinpoint the sources of the experiences in the astral-mental and the etheric-will respectively.\n\nFrom the text given, extract information about the connection between the spiritual organs and the seven Chakras. \nUse the following format: [Chakra]: [Information about the connection]i\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab[Brow]: [See how preparatory images of the heart Chakra appear as echoes of other disclosures.]\n[Throat]: [The remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.]\n[Heart]: [The heart Chakra, the Chakra of the transforming Ego, has already begun this process in the throat Chakra.]\n[Sacral Plexus]: [Notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme.]\n[Solar Plexus]: [Notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme.]\n[Crown]: [The remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.]\u00bb\u00bb",

Patriotism relates to one\u2019s own homeland, including its historical, political, cultural, or ethnic qualities. Patriotism is similar to and can be confused with nationalism, a sort of extreme, antagonistic patriotism; and Chauvinism, an even more extreme variation in which a person becomes unrealistically prejudiced and treats all other countries disrespectfully. Anti-patriotism is the ideology opposite patriotism, which posits that patriotism is wrong because it encourages people to blindly love and sacrifice themselves for their birth country, regardless of how they have been treated there.\n\nSeveral factors affect the level of patriotism in a country. The first of these is the like-mindedness of the people with regard to the principles that shape their lives. People who agree with the prevailing public sentiment and the way the government is performing are more likely to feel patriotic. Security is another factor, as people take pride in their nation\u2019s ability to protect them from harm. A third factor is wealth, as nations are popular with their citizens if they can provide for and allow the enjoyment of wealth. When security and wealth are inadequate or non-existent, we often see refugees seeking better conditions in other countries. Some believe that multicultural areas are a threat to patriotism, including colleges and universities.\n\nWhat country is the most patriotic?\n\nPatriotism can be a difficult thing to measure and quantify, but social scientists and other interested parties continue to create statistical models and surveys with the goal of determining the world's most patriotic country. YouGov conducted an international survey on globalization, surveying groups of people from 19 countries around the world. Respondents were asked whether they believe they live \u201cin the best country in the world,\u201d and their answer determined which were the most patriotic. Based on the YouGov survey, the United States is the most patriotic country, with 41% of its respondents answering \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cMy country is the best country in the world,\u201d and 32% believe that the US is \u201cbetter than most countries.\u201d\n\nAnother study, this time conducted by WIN\/Gallup International, asked respondents in 64 countries if they would be willing to fight and possibly die for their country\u2014arguably the ultimate test of one's patriotism. The results for this survey gave notably different results. Interestingly, in every country survey by both polls, the percentage of respondents who thought their country was the best in the world was lower than the percentage of people willing to fight for that same country.\n\nGallup also noted that the willingness to fight was greater in countries that had experienced civil unrest more recently, such as the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries. Finally, it is worth noting that the survey took place during the time when Afghanistan was ruled by a democratic government and occupied by peacekeeping troops, as opposed to the Taliban-led government currently in power.\n\"\"\"\nCan you give me a summary of the article by making a bullet list that has 6\u20137 points on it?

Today, I often hear from my cousin; he and his wife are very supportive of my ministry.\n\nDoes 2 Corinthians 5:17 mean that we will not have to face the consequences of our past behavior? While it is true that in God's eyes we are white as snow, we still must face our past. We will have problems carried over from past sins. However, the way we look at those problems, our desire to deal with those problems, and the problems themselves (which no longer look insurmountable) will become new! We no longer have to deal with those problems on our own. Our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. In Christ, we can do all things. We face our problems in the light of God's Word, and if God be for us, who can be against us? I am convinced that 2 Corinthians 5:17 means exactly what it says: Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\n\nFounder's Note 11, Step 2:\n\nI wrote earlier about being born physically alive but spiritually dead. To help explain this, we can compare ourselves to computers. Being physically alive, information is being downloaded to us through our five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). We then process this information, and we make decisions based upon what we have processed. For example, because of what I have learned from my senses, if I see a fire, I walk around it and not through it. This information is constantly being downloaded to us and processed by the brain, which results in decisions being made and action being taken or not taken. However, it is true that there are more things unseen than seen. For example, a simple chair has molecules holding it together. There are atoms with protons and neutrons. Gravity is holding that chair in place. I cannot see these things, but they exist. I cannot see a cold virus, but I know it exists. I cannot see the vast expanse of the universe, but I know it is out there. The bottom line is that nothing is as simple as it seems.\n\nEvery human being has a spiritual part, which is a connection that needs to be plugged in to the Spirit of God in order for us to understand things that exist in the spiritual realm. Once we get plugged in, the Holy Spirit starts downloading information and light that illuminates things that were previously in the dark. As a result, we have better and more complete information upon which to base our decisions. The more information we have, the better decisions we will be able to make, and the results of those decisions will be better, too. So how do we get spiritually plugged in? We get spiritually plugged in when we receive the Holy Spirit. This happens when we put our faith and trust in Jesus.\n\n* * *\n\n http:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/restore?s=t.\nStep 3\n\nDecide\n\nI have decided to turn from the things of the past (repent) and to ask   \nJesus to be lord and manager of my life (surrender).\n\n(Discuss each Bible verse by asking, \"How does this particular verse apply to Step 3?\")\n\nNote: Unfortunately, many people never complete Step 2. They may even go as far as believing that Jesus is who He said He is, but this is only intellectual knowledge. They see, they believe, but they do not receive. They make the decision that Jesus and Christianity are not for them. There is no repentance. There is no surrender. At the foot of the cross, a transfer of the will must take place. We lay our will down and receive God's will, God's plan, and God's purpose for our lives. What we know to be true in our heads needs to be transferred to our hearts.\n\nTo open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. (Acts 26:18)\n\nQ. Who is me in the above verse?\n\nQ. We do not just receive forgiveness of sins when we turn to Jesus; what else do we receive?\n\nQ. What does an inheritance mean to you?\n\nFor if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. (2 Chronicles 30:9)\n\nNote: For if ye turn again.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat is the context of this passage?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe context of this passage is the conversion of the apostle Paul. Paul is discussing his own conversion in this passage, specifically his experience on the road to Damascus.

His hands were on his hips, and he was looking everywhere except at Jerry.\n\nIt was a motion Jerry recognized. Robert was gathering his thoughts carefully. Jerry hadn't noticed the belt buckle on his faded blue jeans before, a cowboy riding a bronc. He wondered whether the man had rodeoed. Maybe one day he could ask. Robert had strong forearms, which he could see from where his light blue shirt sleeves were rolled up. His scuffed boots appeared to have had years of use.\n\nJerry felt he should say something. He thought at least five minutes had passed, but he knew in reality it had been maybe ten seconds since Taz and Ivy had walked out the door.\n\n\"What exactly are your intentions with my daughter?\" Robert said. Okay, there it was. Not what he expected, but then, he realized he was stepping into a family that had values. This was an area he wasn't familiar with at all.\n\n\"I want to get to know Taz\u2014\"\n\nRobert cleared his throat, interrupting him, and gestured to the sofa. \"Oh, I saw that much.\"\n\nHe was taking this the wrong way. \"Rob\u2014Mr. Parker,\" Jerry said. He'd almost called him by his first name. Good Lord, what was he thinking? The sharp look had been all he needed for correction. \"I want to date your daughter. Yes, what you saw was personal. I wasn't disrespecting her. I really like her.\" He wanted to say he loved her, but it was too soon. He needed more time. \"She's everything to me, and the moment I met her, I realized she was special. She's a woman I want to get to know. I want to have something that's more...not a fling.\" He stressed this, because for the first time in his life he felt as if he were stumbling around and couldn't put anything coherent together. He was known for clear communication and thinking on the spot in the most dire of circumstances, but not now.\n\n\"I see. So you want to date my daughter or sleep with her?\"\n\nRight to the point. Both, though the second would likely get a fist planted in his mouth if he admitted it. He couldn't help liking this man, this father who was a bigger presence than any guard dog could have been. \"Eventually, yes, I want it all with Taz. I'm not looking for an affair. I want something real, permanent. That's why I'm here, and I'm sorry you walked in on what you did.\"\n\n\"But you're not sorry for what you did?\" Robert tossed right back.\n\nHe could lie, but that would have been a mistake. This man was watching his every move, and he was sure he could read everything\u2014a lie, the truth, an omission. \"No, I'm not. If you want to hit me for that, go ahead. But Taz means something to me, and...\" He wasn't going to talk about sex or anything like that with her father, and neither was he willing to talk about his feelings for a woman he was only beginning to figure out.\n\n\"Let me get this straight. You want to date my daughter, you want a relationship with her, yet you have her nearly naked after knowing her for five minutes. You trying to bullshit me? Why is it you needed to come all this way? I'm sure there are plenty of women where you are in Denver.\n###\n\nPlease rewrite this text to have a more relaxed and confident tone.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAlright, let's get this straight.

Three experts chat about the politics of pork, where meals teach egalitarian values and the one food everyone agrees on is cake.\n\nHow would you define a good lunch? Some of us might say a healthy kale salad, others a delicious burrito, while some may point to the locally raised beef in their burger. But in Martha Sif Karrebaeks' experience, such a question crystallizes the way that language and culture add layers of meaning to what\u2019s on the plate. It\u2019s not just what food we eat that matters, but how we talk about it.\n\nA linguistic ethnographer at the University of Copenhagen, Karrebaek became interested in food while studying language use in a kindergarten classroom. She was struck when the Danish teacher asked an immigrant student what was in his lunchbox. The implication, Karrebaek says, was that the boy\u2019s flatbread wrap wasn\u2019t a \u201cgood\u201d lunch because it wasn\u2019t a traditional Danish one featuring rye bread.\n\nThe divisive immigration debate that has been in the headlines across Europe in recent years leached into the everyday talk about school lunch. And that isn\u2019t a surprise, say Karreaek and fellow linguistic anthropologists Kathleen Riley of Rutgers University, and Jillian Cavanaugh of Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University New York. Food and the conversations around it are key signifiers of culture, identity, and politics, they say.\n\nThe three recently considered the research on food and language in the Annual Review of Anthropology. Some American parents, they write, \u201cengage in intense negotiations over sweets and desserts, which are presumed to be (and perhaps therefore become) children\u2019s preferred foods\u201d. In France, studies show, children are taught to critique food; in Sweden, it\u2019s important that \u201call family members eat the same food\u201d as a symbol of egalitarianism; in non-Western places such as Java, meals may offer a no-talk zone.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nBased on the article provided, elaborate on the studies mentioned.

The last match against Kolkata Knight Riders would have particularly hurt them a lot, but they have to regroup quickly and find a way to bounce back. Royal Challengers Bangalore, on the other hand, made a terrific comeback in the second half of the game against Rajasthan Royals. They have had a good start to the campaign, winning 2 out of the 3 matches. This venue has produced wildly different games. After Rajasthan Royals plundered 210 in their opener, the next two games here have seen scores of 171 and 161. The former was defended by Gujarat Titans while the latter remained competitive until Cummins showed up. Expect teams to still chase and not only because of the dew.

I was just trying to be honest with you.\nEvelin: But why did you have to be so brutal about it? You could have just said that you didn't think I was ready for a relationship, instead of saying that I was too immature and childish.\nMother: Evelin, sometimes mothers just know these things.

I don't want you to get hurt by getting into a relationship that's not right for you.\nEvelin: But how am I supposed to know what's right for me if you don't think I'm capable of making those decisions myself? All my friends are in relationships and they seem happy. Why can't I have that too?\nMother: Just because your friends are in relationships doesn't mean that they're all happy, Evelin. And even if they are happy now, there's no guarantee that their relationships will last. That's why it's important to make sure that you're really ready before getting into one yourself.\nEvelin: But how am I supposed to know if I'm really ready?

It is also possible that her comments were influenced by her own experiences or personal beliefs about relationships.\u00bb\u00bb",

The process results in the evaporation of the planet's atmosphere, leading to the loss of the planet's water and other volatile substances. The loss of water leads to a decrease in the planet's albedo, causing the planet to heat up even more. The process can continue until the planet becomes uninhabitable.\n\nExamples of planetary systems where the runaway greenhouse effect has been observed include the planets of the Vega and Alpha Centauri systems. The planets in these systems are thought to have undergone a runaway greenhouse effect due to their proximity to their stars and the intense radiation they experience.

The Princess wandered along, sometimes beside Poe, sometimes beside Lenehan. She appeared to be lost in her own thoughts as well.\n\nDagma and Laningrin kept Rullin trussed up and dosed with Ice Poppy syrup. Laningrin had his short sword out and kept it handily pointed at the wizard.\n\nRullin stumbled along, muttering angry words under his breath, looking a little green.\n\n'What is he saying, Lan?' Daniel asked, feeling confident about addressing his friend more casually.\n\nThe ranger leaned closer to the wizard.\n\n'He appears to be repeatedly asking why 'He' (whoever He is) would burn him out,' Laningrin replied. 'Also, he is making all kinds of interesting threats. Perhaps we should have allowed Fireforge to take him back?'\n\n'No, I don't want him out of my sight.' Rishana shook her head, overhearing the conversation. 'He's too slippery and Fireforge could not keep him dosed with poppy. It's safer to have him with us, as strange as that sounds.'\n\nDaniel shuddered. Having Rullin so close didn't feel safe at all.\n\nPoe had attempted to dispel the magic that bound Daniel to Rullin, but he conceded that he couldn't completely remove it. While Daniels' arm no longer ached or burned, it still felt unclean in some way. Looking at Rullin made it prickle, even though the wizard was apparently now harmless.\n\nIt took them a couple of hours to clear the forest. Daniel felt lighter as soon as they left the looming trees behind. His legs felt weary, but with Nilofar back on his shoulders, humming to himself, everything was as it should be.\n\nLenehan called a halt.\n\n'Dust ahead - I'd say the royal guards are on their way.' She smiled.\n\n'Good old Fireforge,' Laningrin whooped. 'He's sent them this way.' He slapped Daniel heartily on the back, making him stumble.\n\n'Well, lad, not far for you now. You'll be able to ride back in style.'\n\nDaniel bit his lip. Now would be a good time to admit he had no idea how to ride a horse. But how hard could it be? He'd willingly forgotten how uncomfortable riding Mull had been and how easily the donkey had managed to discard him.\n\nAs they waited, the smudge on the horizon came into focus. Thirty horsemen, in brightly coloured tunics under burnished armour, with lances and swords, bows, arrows and knives all stashed about their persons.\n\nThe horses were solid warriors, with thick muscles and feathery hair on their legs in the likeness of a draught horse. Only, they appeared lighter on their hooves.\n\n'What are those?' Daniel squeaked.\n\n'They are the heavy cavalry. See the smaller ones behind the first row? The light cavalry are far speedier, but not as sturdy,' Nilofar informed him.\n\nWhen the cavalry pulled up in front of the companions, Daniel could make out the difference. Twenty horsemen sat upon the heavy chargers while ten more danced around the outside, whirling their lighter horses around the perimeter.\n\nThere were also pack horses and a series of horses tethered together, which Daniel assumed were for the rangers to take back with them.\n\nThe captain of the guard stayed in the saddle, but bowed from his waist, frowning at Rishana. He had been concerned about having to explain to the Queen how he'd lost her daughter and whilst relieved to see her safe, was a little upset with her for making him worry.\n\n'Your Highness, the Queen sends you her birthday wishes. She is very concerned that you did not locate the sceptre in time for your ceremony.

Now I remember that you rang a silent bell By the foot of the bridge at the River Thames. With dull roots and dried tubers, you wrote poems and laments And grew more English month on month, bowing to kings and princes. Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border, And with them, and with me especially Everything was pig-headed, And I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives, Just so we could start a new fellowship, And we all escaped our personalities, without expressing them. And then I was sent off to Rapallo, trailed by children, And you to your desk at Faber-Faber, Till we had nothing but China and silence in common. And then, when modernism had come to its worst, We wrote, and published in Po-Etry, Through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence, Into a poem of a thousand blank pages, That was the first heave; And into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence. And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouth Out from the East came Confucius and his philosophy, And there came also the True-man Ben-it-o to awe me, Playing in the death-mask of Jefferson. In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid music, Clanging instruments, like the sound of a myriad dying. My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced because my savage mind wouldnt keep still Without his music playing, And I, wrapped in silence, woke up with my head on his lap, And my voice returning to me from every radio, And before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards, or bombs, I had to be off to China, so far across my desktop, You back to your London-bridge. And our Roosevelt, who was brave as a rodent, Was president in Washing Town, and let in the usurious rabble. And one May he sent the soldiers for me, despite the long distance. And what with broken idols and so on, I wont say it wasnt hard going, Over roads twisted like my brains folds. And I was still going, late in the war, with defeat blowing in from the North, Not guessing how little I knew of the cost, and how soon I would be paying it. And what a reception: Steel cages, two books set on a packing-crate table, And I was caught, and had no hope of escaping. And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell, Toward the Alpine peak, with clouds about it as foul as London air, With you whispering, and with a bang, not a whimper, With glasses like dinner plates, glowing grass-green in the darkness, Pleasure-fasting, with women, coming and going without speech, With the dandruff-flakes falling like snow, And the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence, And the sea, knee-deep, reflecting white eyebrows Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight, Hideously aged And the sea-girls singing back at us, Drowning in seaweed brocade, And the wind twisting the song, and desiccating it, Covering our eyes with dust. And this is the way the world ends. With a bang, not with a whimper. I went up to the court for prosecution, Tried standing mute, offered a madmans song, And got no conviction, and went back to Saint Elizabeths Committed. And once again, later, you stood at the foot of my bed, And then the visit ended, you went back to Bloomsbury, And if you ask if I recall that parting: It is like the hair falling from my hieratic head, Confused ... Whirl! Centripetal! Mate! What is the use of talking, until I end my song, I end my song in the dark. I call in the nurse, Hold the pill in my hand As she says, Take this, And swallow it down, silent.\n\"\"\"\nPlease rewrite this poem to have a less disturbing mood and to have longer and more varied sentences.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abI am an AI language model trained to assist you by providing references to a text.\n\nMy reference text is about a man who reflects on his life and the world around him. He is introspective and often feels lost or overwhelmed by the chaos of the world. The tone is somber and resigned, with a sense of impending doom or tragedy. The language is rich and poetic, with many allusions to nature and mythology.\n\nThe poem begins with the speaker addressing a friend who lives in London. The speaker remembers meeting the friend in the past and how they used to be close, but now they are separated by distance and time. The speaker then goes on to describe their own journey, traveling through Europe during World War II. They are constantly on the move, trying to avoid capture by the enemy. The speaker's journey is dangerous and unpredictable, with many setbacks and challenges.\n\nAs the poem progresses, the speaker's tone becomes more despairing and nihilistic. They describe the world as a dark and chaotic place, with war, destruction, and cruelty everywhere. The speaker feels powerless and lost in the face of all this, and they express a sense of hopelessness and despair.\n\nThe poem ends with the speaker acknowledging that the world is coming to an end, with a bang rather than a whimper. They accept their fate and end the poem in silence.\n\nOverall, the poem has a deep and haunting quality, with a sense of tragedy and loss that permeates every line. The language is vivid and imaginative, with many allusions to nature and mythology that add to the poem's sense of grandeur and awe.\u00bb\u00bb",

They are filing lawsuits, marching in the streets in massive numbers, and pressuring world leaders to act.\n\nBut based on the wan commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions that were announced at the UN Climate Summit this week \u2014 and the absence of major polluters like the US from the stage entirely \u2014 key world leaders still aren't willing to take the transformative action scientists say we need to rid the global economy of its fossil fuel dependence.\n\nThe science is clear that we need to act now. And to do so, the adults in power will have to listen to the kids.\n\nAnatomy of a growing movement\n\nThe global climate strikes that brought millions out last Friday weren't just notable for their size.\n\nThe crowds are more diverse, more female and younger than they've ever been before, said Dana R. Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied and surveyed the climate movement for years.\n\nFisher surveyed more than 100 organizers of marches around the country and found even more females in charge, with 68 percent of respondents identifying as female.\n\nThose participating in the DC march were young, with 25 percent under the age of 18, according to Fisher's polling.\n\n\"Since I've been studying the people who participate in these protests, I can tell you that the people who are in the streets are much, much younger than they were before,\" Fisher said.\n\nAlexandria Villase\u00f1or, a 14-year-old activist who has been striking outside the United Nations every Friday for nearly a year, says that her peers need adult allies, but that they have infused the movement with youthful ambition at a critical time.\n\n\"When the youth are leading, we think outside of the box and outside of the system that's been created,\" said Villase\u00f1or. \"We think about what really needs to happen to combat the climate crisis, we don't think about what's politically possible.\"\n\nLittle action from the biggest emitters\n\nThat was the message from a dire report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that detailed what needs to be done to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\n\"It just reflects an incredible disconnect between the politicians who are lagging behind what we're seeing from the youth on the streets, and with what businesses and investors are doing,\" Mountford said.\n\nAll eyes on 2020\n\nOne week after millions of people poured onto streets around the globe, a small crowd gathered outside of New York's city hall Friday, after Greta Thunberg and other youth leaders again called for more strikes.\n\nIn a crowd that skewed very young, many said they had seen the devastating storms and felt the higher temperatures. They said it was deep concern that compelled them to skip school and speak out.\n\n\"We see the studies and we know how scary the situation actually is, and we're acting out of fear,\" said Gabby Campos, a 17-year-old high school student.\n\nOthers like Marco Volpitta, a 17-yard-old who said he has been striking every Friday for a month, said he was frightened by future climate projections, but also felt it was his duty to get involved.\n\n\"We have not just a moral duty to strike, but we have a survivalist imperative to do it,\" he said.\n\nVolpitta and Campos will both be old enough to vote by next November, and they plan to make themselves heard through more traditional means at the polls in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the meantime, their message to leaders echoes Thunberg's: From the halls of Congress to the floor of the UN General Assembly, they say they will be watching.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nPlease rewrite the text to be more emotional and less formal, as though it were written by a passionate, angry mother.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abOh, how I long for the days when I could take my children outside without worrying about the air they breathe or the water they drink! Nowadays, it seems like every day brings a new threat to our planet, and our children's future hangs in the balance.\n\nBut fear not, dear readers! I am here to tell you that we must not despair. Instead, we must rise up and take action. Our children's future depends on it!\n\nThat's why I'm so inspired by the young people who are leading the way in the fight against climate change. Their passion and determination give me hope that we can make a difference.\n\nAnd yet, even as I write this, I am disappointed by the lack of action from our leaders. The science is clear, and yet they continue to drag their feet. It's time for them to wake up and smell the pollution!\n\nWe need bold action now, not empty promises and half-hearted measures. The future of our planet is at stake, and we cannot afford to delay.\n\nSo let us rise up, dear readers! Let us march in the streets, let us demand action from our leaders, and let us fight for a brighter future for our children.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference.\u00bb\u00bb",

She made me feel totally inadequate and I felt like I was back in high school. I mumbled a 'hi' back and looked down at my hands which were buried in my lap.\n\nI vaguely heard Mr. Colburn ask for two coffees and I kept my eyes downcast as Mindy moved away to fill the order. I sat quietly waiting for her to come back with the coffees, wondering, in the somewhat awkward silence, why I'd agreed to this. When Mindy returned with the cups I glanced up at her and noticed she'd opened an extra button or two on her blouse and was now showing a considerable amount of cleavage. My 'date' however, didn't pay any attention to the display as she leaned over to place the coffee in front of him. I couldn't resist smiling a little as she flounced away from our table, her disappointment at the lack of reaction to her charms evident in every sway of hips.\n\nWith Mindy gone we should have felt free to talk, but we didn't. I floundered around in my head trying to think of something to say. Everything that I came up with sounded forced. As the silence stretched, I couldn't stand it any longer and I blurted out, \"Mr. Colburn, why did you ask me for coffee if you're just going to sit there and not say anything? A... are you regretting asking me?\"\n\nHe looked up at me then with those beautiful eyes. I noticed he had long thick black lashes that should be illegal on a man. \"First it's 'Cole' not Mr. Colburn, and second, no I'm definitely not regretting inviting you.\"\n\n\"So why are you sitting in silence? I mean this is the first time you've even looked at me since we sat down.\"\n\nHe smiled at me and I almost swooned, not only should those eyelashes be illegal, a smile like that should be as well. His smile did things to my insides that I didn't even want to think about. \"I have been looking at you. You just don't know it because you've been studying your hands all this time. Look, Victoria,\" he lowered his voice. \"About last night, I feel I need to explain.\"\n\nI interrupted him. There was no way anybody I was going to let anybody use that antiquated name. \"It's either Miss Hudson or Vic, please never 'Victoria', only my parents' generation or those even older call me Victoria.\"\n\n\"Not 'Mouse'? Isn't that what the waitress called you?\"\n\n\"No, definitely not 'Mouse'. That was a nasty nickname the girls and even some of the boys, called me in high school.\"\n\n\"Mice are gray, like your eyes, or a soft brown, like your hair. They are also clever, quick-witted and cute.\" His eyes were twinkling now.\n\n\"Cute? Mice are cute? You gotta be kidding me.\"\n\n\"I like them. But I'll call you 'Vic' if you prefer... for now.\" The teasing look in his eyes changed to something more serious.\n\nMy stomach did a little flip flop at that 'for now'. Did that mean he was interested and... No I wasn't even going to think about what that might've meant. I took a deep breath to kill the butterflies that were fluttering inside me. Lowering my eyes, I took a sip of my coffee to cover my inner feelings. But I couldn't keep my eyes lowered; I raised them again to feast on his handsome face. \"You were going to explain about last night?\"\n\nHe cocked an eyebrow and his eyes were twinkling at me as if he knew the effect he'd had on me. \"Hmm? Yes. I told you that I'm new in town, and I really didn't want to get involved with the police before I'd even settled in.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat is the source of the awkwardness in this exchange?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe awkwardness in this exchange is due to the protagonist's feelings of inadequacy in comparison to Mindy, as well as the protagonist's nervousness and uncertainty about the situation. Additionally, the protagonist's use of the term \"date\" to describe the situation may make Mr. Colburn feel uncomfortable, as it implies a more formal and serious relationship than he may be interested in. Finally, the protagonist's interruption of Mr. Colburn's explanation and her strong reaction to the term \"Mouse\" may also contribute to the overall awkwardness of the exchange.\u00bb\u00bb",

If you haven\u2019t seen the movie, I would recommend it! (it was reviewed here previously) It is one of my favorites\u2013fun, funny, flashy, action-packed, and with an overall very likable cast of characters. The most likable character in the story is the topic of this essay: Baymax.\n\nSummary\nBaymax, in his own words, is a \u201cpersonal healthcare companion.\u201d He is a prototype designed by Tadashi Hamada, a resident of San Fransokyo, who died tragically young in a building explosion before he could do more than private experiments on the prototype.\n\nAfter his death, Tadashi\u2019s brother Hiro finds the robot in their shared bedroom and Baymax with his medical skills discovers that Hiro is grieving and attempts to help him, by connecting him with his and Tadashi\u2019s mutual friends from a college of advanced technology, and by helping him find the person responsible for Tadashi\u2019s death.\n\nBaymax develops more and more of a superhero persona as Hiro tries to reinvent him as a powerful superheroic juggernaut with martial arts powers, jets, and projectile fists. Baymax goes along with this on the thin premise that this is all part of Hiro\u2019s treatment to prevent depression and largely goes along with whatever Hiro wants until Hiro asks too much and asks Baymax to take a human life and Baymax refuses. Blinded by grief, Hiro removes Baymax\u2019s nurse chip and the rest of Hiro\u2019s friends narrowly prevent Baymax from killing while he is not himself. This is a major turning point in the movie as Baymax draws a personal boundary and refuses to let Hiro cross it, not allowing Hiro to access his programming chips again afterward. But in the end, Baymax forgives him and they join forces again to win the day, and Baymax even gives what can be considered a selfless act to save Hiro\u2019s life (while also doing his best to prolong himself).\n\nThroughout all of this, Baymax is very empathetic, funny, sweet, and helpful. Hiro\u2019s well-being is his primary concern, as much of his actions in the movie are justified by helping Hiro find closure, as well as combating depression with adrenaline rushes. Baymax\u2019s programming is focused on caring for others and it shows in the way he nurtures his team, including acting as a flotation device when the whole group drives a car into water, and then helping them warm up by generating his heat.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Baymax is likable. But, is he likable because he can\u2019t possibly be otherwise? Is he simply a product of his nature? He was designed to act as a nurturer and healer, does that mean that he is compassionate, that he is a good person?\n\nHe certainly is a nurturer and healer in effect\u2013he never harms a human being in the film, and others are often in better health or better mood because of him. Even when he\u2019s not directly working in a healthcare-related way, his attempts to empathize bring him closer to the people who surround him. In one scene, as he is watching fireworks with Hiro, Hiro has his legs extended in front of him and swings his feet back and forth in an idle motion, and Baymax imitates him in a show of connecting with him.\n\nBut, deep inside, is Baymax compassionate? Or is it merely that he can\u2019t help but take compassionate actions? Does Baymax feel anything or is he just a process of his programming?\n\nI think there is some evidence that Baymax goes outside of his programming in the course of his film. In particular, the fact that he is so easily convinced to take Hiro on dangerous actions, to a degree that I don\u2019t think is fully plausible if healthcare is his only concern. I think that if that were true, then Baymax, instead of giving in to almost all of Hiro\u2019s demands, would be questioning Hiro\u2019s increasingly risky behavior and whether it signals some kind of mental condition that needs treatment for the safety of himself and others.\n\nThese questions have often crossed my mind since I watched this movie, and more and more I have concluded that: it doesn\u2019t matter. When we deal with our fellow human beings, we can\u2019t see into their minds, we can only judge a person by their words and their actions. Baymax is no different. Or, if he is different, he\u2019s simply easier to judge as having a compassionate effect because it\u2019s easier to take his actions as not having ulterior motives since we know what he was designed for.\n\"\"\"\n\nRead the information provided about the character Baymax from Big Hero 6. Your job is to rate it on a scale of 2-8 (2=not, 5=moderately, 8=definitely), the likelihood that Baymax is actually compassionate. Provide an explanation that is 1-2 sentences long.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab8\n\nBaymax is definitely compassionate. He is a personal healthcare companion designed to help others. He even goes above and beyond his programming by creating a superhero persona to save the day.\u00bb\u00bb",

The IOC selected three of the bids as candidate cities. On July 4, 2013, Buenos Aires was elected as host city.\n\nBidding timeline\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched the bidding process on September 15, 2011. A letter was sent out to all National Olympic Committees (NOCs). The key dates are the following: \n\n 2012\n March 1: Deadline for NOCs to submit to the IOC of the names of YOG Applicant Cities\n March 2: IOC announced that six applications for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics have been received\n March 15: Signature of YOG Candidature Procedure\n October 15: Submission of YOG Candidature File and other documents\n October to December: Examination of replies by IOC and experts\n\n 2013\n February 13: Shortlist of YOG Candidate Cities by the IOC Executive Board\n February: Additional questions to shortlisted Candidate Cities\n March: Video conferences between the bid committees and the IOC Evaluation Commission\n June 4: Report by the IOC Evaluation Commission\n July 4: Election of the host city of the 3rd Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2018.\n\nVote\n\nThe host city election vote was held at an extraordinary IOC Session in Lausanne. The results were as follows:\n\nCandidate cities\n\nThere were six bids for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games confirmed by the International Olympic Committee. Bids were due by March 1, 2012. The list of applicant cities was announced by the IOC on March 2, 2012.\n\nFor the first time, Asian NOCs didn't submitted a bid for the Summer Youth Olympics, thus making it the first time that Asia will not bid, and eventually, host the Games. Three European NOCs (Great Britain, The Netherlands and Poland) entered Glasgow, Rotterdam and Pozna\u0144 bids respectively. American NOCs Argentina, Colombia and Mexico also submitted bids for Buenos Aires, Medell\u00edn and Guadalajara respectively. Poznan withdrew their bid in October 2012.\n\nOn February 13, 2013, the IOC Executive Board selected three candidate cities.\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\n\nOn August 30, 2011, Buenos Aires and the Argentine Olympic Committee announced that they will bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games. Buenos Aires bid to host the 1956 and 2004 Summer Olympics but lost to Melbourne and Athens respectively.\n\nGlasgow, United Kingdom\n\nOn September 19, 2011, it was announced that Glasgow would submit to the British Olympic Association (BOA) a proposal to bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The city has never made an Olympic bid before. On February 22, 2012, the BOA agreed to put Glasgow forward as the United Kingdom's bidding city for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics.\n\nGlasgow's bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics marked the first time a city in Scotland has made a bid for an Olympic Game.\n\nLondon has made four successful bids for the Summer Olympic Games in the past. They were awarded the 1908, 1944, 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The 1944 Games however were cancelled due to World War II, however London still hosted the games three years after the war ended.\n\nMedell\u00edn, Colombia\n\nMedell\u00edn bid for the games after successfully hosting the 2010 South American Games and having all the venues already built in the complex Atanasio Girardot. Colombia has never made an Olympic bid before. The country held the 1971 Pan American Games in Cali. In January 2012, Andres Botero Phiillipsbourne was promoted to Sports Minister of Colombia. He is an IOC member and will be working to promote the bid.\n\nNon-selected applicant cities\n\nGuadalajara, Mexico\n\nGuadalajara was selected over Monterrey on February 16, 2012, to be put forward as an applicant city. Guadalajara bid for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but withdrew their bid before the IOC vote due to a poor evaluation report. Guadalajara hosted the 2011 Pan American Games.\n\nRotterdam, Netherlands\n\nOn February 29, 2012, the day before the deadline for bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, it was announced that Rotterdam would be putting forth a bid.\n\nCancelled bids\n\nPozna\u0144, Poland\n\nUpon the announcement by the IOC of who the applicant cities were, Pozna\u0144 was revealed as one of the bidders. The city bid for the 2010 and 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but lost to Singapore and Nanjing respectively. On 8 October, the city council rejected the proposal budget of the bid. There were lack of financial guarantees from the city-organizer, so the city withdrew.\n\nMonterrey, Mexico\n\nBids which did not go to application\n\nThe following cities proposed putting forth bids, but ultimately failed to do so:\n\n  Toulouse, France\n  Abuja, Nigeria\n  Kaspiysk, Russia\n  Durban, South Africa\n  Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6 or Stockholm, Sweden\n  Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n  Raleigh, United States\n\nWhat factors influenced the selection of Buenos Aires as the host city for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abBuenos Aires was selected as the host city for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics due to its high-quality bid that included an attractive sports program, impressive venues, and a comprehensive sustainability plan. The city also has a strong track record of hosting major international events, including the 1978 FIFA World Cup and the 1982 FIVB Men's World Championship. Additionally, Buenos Aires has a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant nightlife scene, which makes it an attractive destination for young athletes and visitors from around the world.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abExplain how a bolt works. I want an answer in the form of a paragraph.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abA bolt is a type of fastener that is used to connect two or more objects together. It consists of a threaded pin or rod that is usually made of metal, and a washer-like head on one end that is designed to fit into a matching hole in the other object. The head of the bolt is usually larger than the pin or rod, and may have a rounded or square shape. When the bolt is tightened, the head compresses the materials around it, creating a strong mechanical bond.\n\nTo use a bolt, you first need to make sure that the hole in the object is the correct size for the bolt. The hole should be slightly larger than the diameter of the pin or rod, but not so large that the bolt will become loose. You then insert the bolt into the hole, making sure that the head is on the outside of the object. You can then use a tool such as a wrench or a screwdriver to tighten the bolt by rotating the head in a clockwise direction. As you tighten the bolt, the head will compress the materials around it, creating a strong mechanical bond that holds the objects together.\n\nBolt fasteners are commonly used in a variety of applications, from construction and manufacturing to home improvement and automotive repair. They are strong, durable, and easy to use, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications.\u00bb\u00bb",

Those with co-occurring developmental conditions, such as epilepsy or intellectual disability, are even more likely to have chronic pain.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that people with autism may experience pain differently than neurotypical people do. Their pain may also be compounded by the sensory sensitivities and gastrointestinal problems frequently associated with autism. But the topic remains understudied, experts say.\n\nThe new study reveals that pain is \u201ca really common experience for kids with autism,\u201d says study investigator Danielle Shapiro, assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cThey\u2019re experiencing physical pain, even though it\u2019s not typically thought of as a core feature of [autism].\u201d\n\nShapiro and a colleague used data from the 2016-2017 U.S. National Survey of Children\u2019s Health, a questionnaire that asks parents about their children\u2019s medical diagnoses and whether the children experienced chronic or repeated pain over the previous year. Their analysis included 50,063 children aged 6 to 17 years, including 1,472 with autism.\n\nDetecting distress:\nAbout 16 percent of children with autism experienced chronic or repeated pain in the previous year, the team found. For autistic children with co-occurring conditions, that figure is just under 20 percent. By comparison, only about 8 percent of typical children experienced frequent pain, according to their parents. (About 800 of the nearly 49,000 children in this control group have epilepsy, intellectual disability or cerebral palsy.) The findings appeared 28 October in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all to see that the prevalence of general pain complaints is elevated [in this population],\u201d says David Moore, senior lecturer in psychology at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the work. \u201cThis is an important public-health issue for this group that we need to do a better job of addressing.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analysis is based on parent reports, which don\u2019t always tell the whole story, experts caution. This is especially true for autistic children, who may have difficulty communicating that they are in pain.\n\n\u201cA parent\u2019s report of pain is sort of a proxy,\u201d says Micah Mazurek, associate professor of human services at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who was not involved in the research. \u201cPain is an internal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cFor very young children, and for those who don\u2019t have language, it\u2019s hard to assess that directly.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s findings should urge doctors to be especially vigilant about identifying pain in people with autism, Mazurek says.\n\nShapiro hopes the study will be a \u201cspringboard\u201d for pain research, including work that looks at the sources of autistic children\u2019s pain.\n\n\u201cThat would serve as a pathway to help us think about how to address pain in kids with autism,\u201d she says.\n\nUsing the following format, provide the key information for each professor or researcher mentioned in the article:\n(Name: {Professor or researcher's name}\nUniversity: {University the professor\/researcher is associated with}\nQuote: {The professor\/researcher's quote in the article})\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abName: Danielle Shapiro\nUniversity: University of Michigan\nQuote: \"The new study reveals that pain is a really common experience for kids with autism.

The band's rhythm was somewhere between a waltz and the hum of an old refrigerator. The girl's voices were now only slightly more annoying than a great accordion player. We had a real dilemma. Do we just run over the band and singers and hope that the SUV can plow through the remaining zombies or do we stay with the status quo and hope enough live to get us to the New York Times Building? The decision would have been made easier if someone in the band hadn't stopped muting his trombone with a duck caller. That would have been motivation for me to throw the car into overdrive and make the musicians one with their instruments.\n\nWe decided to weigh our options, which didn't work because we couldn't agree on an appropriate rating system, so we tried to write down the positives and negatives, but that was even harder without a pen and pencil. After three tries we finally figured out that odd finger doesn't work well with over three people. We didn't have dice or cards, so we used our old standby and played a game of charades. The driver, who at the moment wasn't me, didn't have to participate. Movie titles we found too easy, the names of presidents too hard, so we settled on popular surgeries. We were all stumped on pubic hair transplants, even Laura Lee, who was good enough to go pro, but by that time we were just a block away and decided to let the exhausted band play on until eaten. I know it sounded cold-hearted, but these musicians weren't in a union yet, and why wait till they tried to organize?\n\nWhen we got close to the building the band members stuffed the plume from their hats in the mouths of ululation vocalists and then tossed them at the zombies and ran for the entrance. We had driven the car to the only available parking space, about ten yards from the home of the New York Times and dumped some coins in the meter. I wasn't taking chances\u2014who knows what parking fines might mean in these days of deadly choices. With the zombies only a few yards behinds us, the doors of the Time's building flew open and a gang of Times' workers started knocking off our stalkers. They're aim was amazing, zombies fell prey to flying rolls of daily newspapers and the ones that managed to move closer got flattened by thick stacks of the Sunday edition.\n\nThe Times Building and Shrimp\n\nThe entire band also made it to safety, but thankfully none of the female singers went uneaten. In the band members' haste to live, they left all their instruments lying dormant in the street.\n\nInstruction:\nExplain the events that occur in this text in chronological order in at least 5 sentences.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab1. The band members are playing music in the street, which causes the zombies to move toward the SUV, where our group is hiding.\n\n2. The band runs away from the zombies, but they leave their instruments in the street.\n\n3. Our group discusses the options, and then they decide to drive the SUV over the band and the zombies and hope that the SUV can plow through the remaining zombies.\n\n4. The band members get to safety by getting inside the New York Times Building, but the female singers do not.\n\n5. The group is able to get away from the zombies by driving the SUV to the New York Times Building and getting inside.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abThe reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nA short article in the newspaper the other day reminded me of my promise to write about garden tools from time to time.  If you didn\u2019t catch the story then try to guess what sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury and George Bernard Shaw had to do with garden spades\u2026 or rather a particular garden spade and why were they all in the news that day?   Answer at the end of this post.\n\nIn the meantime here\u2019s some more about the history of humble spade, the tool that\u2019s at the top of every list of historic garden tools.\n\nThe spade started out as a symbol that gardening is officially hard work!\n\nWhen  Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they were told: \u2018Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food\u2019 (Genesis, 3:17\u201319. New International Version).  But of course neither Adam nor Eve knew how to cultivate a garden so they had a lot to learn!\n\nThe first representation of a spade I can find is actually part of one of the oldest stained glass panels  in Canterbury cathedral.  It shows Adam hard at work using an iron-tipped spade with a mattock hanging on the branch of a nearby tree. Adam maybe be partially dressed but you\u2019ll notice he isn\u2019t wearing any shoes.\n\nAdam had to be taught how to dig, and Eve how to spin and so an angel [usually said to be the Archangel Michael] was sent down to instruct them. Images of this  were a popular subject in the Middle Ages and it was widely depicted in medieval manuscript illuminations, wall paintings and stained glass.   A window in Lincoln cathedral  depicts the angel demonstrating the art of digging, with one foot resting on a spade in the same manner as Adam, and again barefooted\u2026.\n\n\u2026but by the time Adam\u2019s son Cain was murdering his brother Abel with a handy spade, stouter footwear had been invented!\n\nThe earliest spades were made of wood, and were obviously extremely heavy and inefficient to use. The blade was usually edged with iron to give a better cutting edge, and  sometimes (as in the example below) off-set to provide a ledge for the digger\u2019s foot, but most  illustrations have a central shaft.\n \nThe spade was the gardener\u2019s main tool. The French writer Louis Liger wrote: \u2018As a soldier can\u2019t fight without his arms, so a gardener can\u2019t work without proper tools\u2019, although he also suggests that the spade is \u2018chiefly used by apprentices\u2019. But by Liger\u2019s time  this heavy clumsy instrument has been improved by making the entire blade of plate iron. It was forged with iron straps  that were bolted to the wooden handle. But this caused problems of a different sort because having an iron blade meant that the metal was going to cut into the gardeners foot as they dug. The solution was either to turn the sharp upper edge of the blade over to form a tread or to strap iron plates  to the gardeners boots or clogs.\n\nIron tools were very heavy, difficult to keep sharp &amp; liable to rust but,  as technology improved,  by end of 19thc lighter steel blades had been introduced with treads welded to iron sockets and with hollow shanks.\n\nThere have been dozens if not hundreds of different kind of spades used in this country \u2013 at one point almost every county had its own specialty .\n\nListen to this description of a spade like shovel in use in the west country. The head Gardener at Bicton near Exmouth described the local spade in 1843:  \u201ctheir spade is an ugly home-made heart-shaped bit of heavy iron, with a great socket in it; and they form the handle themselves by cutting a great lumbering stick out of a hedge, six or seven feet in length about the size of a hop pole so they can always use it without bending their backs.\n\nA similar sounding spade was used in  west Wales too. Made in a local forge until 1976 they were designed to avoid back-bending work, and were sometimes known as lazy-back shovels. They were also known as the Irish potato spade, the Lurgan shovel and the Celtic shovel.\n\nThen there much more specialised spades of all sorts\u2026.here\u2019s just a tiny selection\n\nIncidentally have you noticed the different kinds of handles you can get \u2013 apparently D or Y handles are the preference down south \u2013 but T handles are preferred in the north. Does anyone have any ideas why?\n\nElsewhere,  no handle grip is the pattern in France and Ireland \u2013 but then the French and the Irish like spades with very long shafts unlike the English\u2026 we tend to bend our backs when we dig whereas they prefer to rest the shaft on their knee or thigh\u2026.and what about the shape of the blade\u2026. flat and square? round-ended? pointed? or even, as the trend is now becoming, just ever so slightly tilted away from the vertical.  The world of the spade is obviously more complex than most of us supposed!\n\nAnd there still people trying to improve on the spade\u2026 how about this two handled version?\n\nOr this auto spade  which actually dates back 50 years or so to a company called Terrex.\n\nAnd whatever happened to the mechanical \u2018spadet\u2019 complete with sexist commentary dating from 1950 \u2026.\n\nEven today .Spear and Jackson make 25 different sorts, whilst  Bulldog still list over 20  \u2013 not including this one which is the world\u2019s largest according the Guinness book of records.  It is 3.61 meters high, and weighs 180 kg.\n\nNow the answer to the question at the start of this post.   George Bernard Shaw\u2019s garden spade, and an unpublished poem by Ray Bradbury that was inspired  by it [I joke not!] are being auctioned in Los Angeles, and expected to fetch about $5,000. According to The Times  of September 24, 2014 (p.26), Bradbury was given the spade as a Christmas present, and \u2018delighted to be holding an item that had belonged to his literary hero Bradbury wrote the poem \u201cGeorge Bernard Shaw and the Spade\u201d  to celebrate a man he described as the most important influence in literature\u2026.   A metal plaque on the spade says: With this spade Bernard Shaw planted a mulberry tree in the public garden at Great Malvern on his 80th birthday, the 26th July 1936. He then presented to Harry Batchelor Higgs, his gardener and faithful friend for 34 years.\u2019     Here is the poem\u2026 Make of it what you will!\n\nRate how useful, from 1-10 (1= not useful, 10=most useful) the spade is as a gardening tool. Explain some of the benefits of choosing a spade over other gardening tools. Keep the response under three sentences.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSpades are a helpful gardening tool. The spade is an excellent tool for gardening, and its versatility and ease of use make it a favorite among gardeners. You can use it to turn the soil, create furrows, plant, or transplant small plants and shrubs. The sharp edge of the blade allows for precise digging and can be used to dig holes of different sizes, making it a versatile tool for various gardening tasks.\u00bb\u00bb",

Who doesn\u2019t love a book club with their best friend? So many books focus on family life, historical events, romance, and *cough* men. But the coming-of-age memoir is getting a makeover. Each of the following books centers on a long-term, life-defining friendship. Spanning the 1950s to the \u201870s to the 21st century, these books are chaotic, inspiring, and heart-wrenching meditations on platonic love and intimacy, in particular platonic love and intimacy between women. These books are bound \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 to inspire conversation and appreciation between you and your forever friends for hours on end. \n\nMy Brilliant Friend, by Elena Ferrante\nUgh, this book broke my heart and taped it back together, and broke it again. It\u2019s the first of Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan Novels, a four-book story detailing the parallel lives of childhood best friends, Elena and Lila, as they come of age in Naples, Italy in the 1950s. The writing is beautiful, but what\u2019s special about the book is its unwavering attention to female friendship. The most formative relationship in these girls\u2019 lives is the one they share. While both girls are gifted students, only Elena has the resources and familial support to complete a formal education. This divergence splits the two apart, opening a new world to one girl and building a wall in front of the other. When I finished reading it, I immediately wanted to call all of my friends and tell them how much I love them.\n\nYou Made A Fool Of Death With Your Beauty, by Akwaeke Emezi You Made A Fool Of Death With Your Beauty is a deliciously fun romance novel, in which a young, widowed artist (Feyi) jets off to the Caribbean with a man she just met, only to find herself attracted to his father instead. Throughout the book, Feyi leans on her lover-turned-best-friend-turned-roommate (Joy) for tough love and advice. The two galavant around NYC at the story\u2019s outset. Joy appears throughout the book in FaceTime and phone calls, an unwavering source of love and comedic relief. The romance is steamy, but wouldn\u2019t feel nearly as fun without Joy\u2019s commentary along the way. It\u2019s a romance tailor-made for sunny summer days and discussion over brunch with your most chaotic partner-in-crime.\n\nConversations With Friends OR Beautiful World Where Are You, by Sally Rooney I couldn\u2019t pick just one! While Rooney\u2019s best-known work is the romance-inflected Normal People, her first and third novels put female friendship front and center. Conversations With Friends is a comedy of errors in which two college girlfriends turned best friends (Frances and Bobbi) and aspiring writers get wrapped up in the strained marriage of an older artist and her husband. Beautiful World Where Are You has a similar structure. A successful but reclusive writer (Alice) and her best friend (Eileen), a broke editor, correspond via long, rambling emails about aesthetics and politics, and the woes of 21st-century life. In both books, the pairs of friends pursue independent romantic relationships, but they\u2019re of lesser importance, and consequence, to the friendships they share. Be warned: these books WILL make you want to email your closest friends. \n\nJust Kids, by Patti Smith\nThis is my favorite book of all time. In Just Kids, godmother of punk music Patti Smith writes the story of her young life alongside the late, famed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. They met as starving artists in 1960s New York City, a relationship that evolved from a romantic entanglement to a deep, platonic intimacy that defined the rest of their lives. Before Mapplethorpe passed away, Smith promised to write the story of their life together. Never before have I witnessed a friendship so intimate that one person could write the memoir of the other. They were attuned to one another in an otherworldly way \u2014 life partners in nearly every sense of the word. It\u2019ll make you appreciate the friends in your life and aspire to see and be seen by them with the reverence that Smith and Mapplethorpe shared. \n\nTopics of Conversation, by Miranda Popkey\nThis is one for the chatty, the artistic, and the (lightly) philosophical \u2014 for your informal self-proclaimed social anthropologist friend with whom you ruminate on the intricacies of sex, romance, society, power, gender, and aging into the wee hours of the night. (Any Fleabag fans here?) The book uses interactions between women to tell the life story of an unnamed narrator who seeks intellectual artistic stimulation in her younger years only to be reshaped by the gendered expectations of her later life. The narrator is lonely, but her choices and experiences are endlessly thought-provoking. It\u2019s one of those books (I say from experience) where if you read it side-by-side with a friend, you\u2019ll have no choice but to take breaks and talk each section out.\n###\nPlease scan the text and extract the titles of the books about friendship and their respective authors mentioned in the passages.

Floodplains protect cities from flooding and provide food-rich, safe habitats for freshwater creatures. The largest floodplain of the San Francisco Estuary is the Yolo Bypass. The Yolo Bypass is connected to the Sacramento River and protects Sacramento and surrounding areas from flooding. A twenty-plus year scientific monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass has documented many benefits that this floodplain provides to the Estuary. For example, the Yolo Bypass is a nursery area for baby fish such as young Chinook salmon and Sacramento splittail, and it is an important food bank that transports fish food to the rest of the Estuary. This article discusses some of the benefits that floodplains provide for fish species, and it highlights the importance of long-term monitoring to help scientists and managers make decisions for the benefit of fishes and ecosystems.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the Yolo Bypass floodplain in the San Francisco Estuary, and how does it protect the surrounding areas from flooding? Additionally, what benefits does the floodplain provide for fish species, particularly young Chinook salmon and Sacramento splittail, and how does it contribute to the overall health of the Estuary's ecosystem?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe Yolo Bypass floodplain serves as a critical nursery area for young fish species, such as Chinook salmon and Sacramento splittail, and helps transport food resources to the rest of the Estuary. Additionally, it provides important habitat for other freshwater creatures and helps protect surrounding areas from flooding by serving as a natural buffer.\u00bb\u00bb",

It's like, everything happens to me and I just have to deal with it.\nRichard: Well, what do you want to be in control of?\nVincente: Everything! I want to be able to make my own decisions and not have to worry about whether or not they're the right ones. I want to know that if something goes wrong, it's because I made a mistake and not because someone else messed up.\nRichard: That's a tall order, Vincente. Life is never going to be perfectly controllable.\nVincente: I know that. But it would be nice if things were at least manageable. Right now, it feels like everything is out of my hands and there's nothing I can do about it.\nRichard: What specifically are you talking about? Is there something that's happened recently that's got you feeling this way?\nVincente: It's just everything. It feels like I can't catch a break. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and I'm just so sick of it.\nRichard: Okay, let's try to talk through some of this then. What's the first thing that comes to mind?\nVincente: Well, take my job for example. I've been working at the same company for years and I'm just not getting anywhere. My boss never notices me, no matter how hard I work, and I'm just stuck in this dead-end job with no chance of advancement. And it's not like I can just quit because I need the money.\nRichard: That does sound frustrating. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?\nVincente: No, because what would be the point? He doesn't care about me or my career; he only cares about himself. And even if I did talk to him, it wouldn't change anything anyway.\nRichard: You're right, it might not change anything immediately, but it would at least be a way to express how you're feeling and hopefully start a dialogue about what you want and what you think you deserve.\nVincente: Yeah, but like I said, he doesn't care about me or what I want.

And here's the best bit: a well-developed lower body also tells the world you're doing more in the gym than benching and curling #IYKYK.\n\nNot that quad exercises are only good for aesthetics. A study published in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science found that patients with knee osteoarthritis were able to soothe knee pain and move more freely if they had stronger quads.\n\nMost people work their quads via squats, but there are so many more quad exercises to explore and enjoy. Below, our Fitness Editor Andrew Tracey takes us through 10 of the best, as well as the most effective quad-dominant workouts to get the best out of them. Time to join the quad squad.\n\nYour Quad Muscles\nKnowing the muscles that you're working will help when you feel them burning. Unsurprisingly, your quadriceps, or quads, consist of four muscles. They are:\n\nRectus Femoris: This muscle runs straight down your thigh and helps with knee and hip flexion.\n\nVastus Lateralis: The largest of the four quad muscles, it connects your thighbone to your kneecap.\n\nVastus Medialis: This muscle's function is to extend your knee joint and help stabilise your kneecap.\n\nVastus Intermedius: Along with other muscles in your knee, the vastus intermedius facilitates knee extension.\n\nThe Benefits of Training Quads\nFor the majority of people, the primary benefits of training quads will make everyday movements \u2013 walking, bending, sitting \u2013 easier. But there's a protective element, too, with consistent quad exercises helping improve the stability of your kneecap and strengthening your knee joint from injury. A study published in The Journal of Rheumatology also found that quad exercises can lower your risk of developing knee osteoarthritis and help prevent degenerative wear and tear.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nI'm new to working out and unsure of the terminology. What are the different muscles that make up your quads, and what are the benefits of training them?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abYour quads consist of four muscles: Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, and Vastus Intermedius. Training your quads can improve the stability of your kneecap and strengthen your knee joint from injury. Additionally, consistent quad exercises can lower your risk of developing knee osteoarthritis and help prevent degenerative wear and tear.\u00bb\u00bb",

He's close in terms of space but he's not close in terms of what he can teach you or what he can tell you, so emotionally he's quite distant from you. At the moment, for example, in this auditorium many of you are emotionally distant from each other, even though you're sitting right next to each other. You are completely emotionally disconnected from each other. You can be in the same physical space but at the same time totally out of rapport with each other, not even understanding what your next door neighbour is thinking, feeling or expressing in any way. It's exactly the same for a spirit. A spirit can be sitting right next to you but be totally out of rapport with you because of the difference in their emotional condition and their condition in love compared to yours at that moment.\n\nParticipant: Ironically that would mean some intermediary spirit would carry the same wounds as you so he could communicate through that wound?\n\nCorrect. Often they do have wounds, but they're learning the process of how to release those wounds. However, often they have similar wounds and therefore there's a distortion of the higher spirit's communication through that wound.\n\n4.2. Inaccuracies during Angelo's channelling\n\nI can give one illustration of when Peter was channelling. When I started asking questions about where his soulmate was and the condition that Angelo himself is in, Peter's emotions started kicking in. That's when we started getting inaccurate information. Angelo is not in the fifteenth dimension, but this is something that Peter would like to believe is true. And his soulmate does not necessarily have the injury that Peter described. Those particular things come from some of Peter's feelings, and Peter's feelings about the world, and Peter's lady's feelings.\n\nParticipant: So in this case Angelo didn't lie, it just didn't come through because of the emotion?\n\nAngelo is still telling the truth, or attempting to, but Peter cannot accurately hear it while that emotional injury exists. Do not assume that the spirit is the person at fault. We must always assume that it's our own condition that is causing the inaccuracy in communication, always. The spirit, even a spirit in a first sphere condition, is very rarely at fault in their communication with regard to what they believe to be true, but often what they believe doesn't get accurately reflected.\n\nThis is why many of you can visit a medium and they'll say, \"This spirit says he's in the seventh dimension, he's this and that, this and that,\" but he's really in the hells of the first dimension. However we often believe he's in the seventh, and sometimes the person who's doing the mediumship believes it. The spirit may not believe he's in the seventh but sometimes the person doing the mediumship would like to believe he's in the seventh and that's why the spirit, the person, says all of those things. [01:17:40.27]\n\nMary: I feel that it requires a lot of humility on the part of the medium to be able to be open enough emotionally to feel the emotions of the spirits involved, because the minute that we can do that we very often get feedback that says, \"What he says, that's wrong,\" or \"I have to step back now.\n<end of reference>\nWhat are some common emotional injuries that can distort communication between spirits?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abOne common emotional injury that can distort communication between spirits is the inability to release wounds. Spirits often have similar wounds, and when they communicate through those wounds, the communication can be distorted. Another emotional injury that can distort communication is a difference in emotional condition between the spirit and the person they are communicating with.\u00bb\u00bb",

During the regular monthly meeting on Sept. 26 in Arichat, Richmond Municipal Council accepted a recommendation from its committee of the whole to write a letter advocating the \"advancement of the broadband agenda\" to Cape Breton-Canso MP Mike Kelloway, and have staff \"continue to explore funding opportunities.\" CAO Troy MacCulloch said the first draft of a letter is coming from all municipalities across the province, and noted that the Municipality of the County of Antigonish took the lead on this project.\n\nCouncillors approved other motions from the committee of the whole session to: grant the NSCC Strait Area Campus a 15-month lease on land along Unity Drive in the Point Tupper Industrial Park to conduct a heavy equipment operator program; have staff explore the feasibility of installing a fire hydrant on Langley Lane in Point Tupper; request that a staff member and councillor be assigned a position on the Offshore Wind Task Force and Point Tupper Energy Development Committee; provide $669 to ACTing Collectively for a mail-out to seniors; explore funding opportunities and contact the Louisdale Lions Club concerning their request for washrooms at the group's recreation facilities; write a letter to Kelloway supporting retroactive pay for RCMP officers; approve a grant of $3,750 to Holy Guardian Angels Parish; and approve $500 in sponsorship to the Rural Communities Foundation of Nova Scotia.\n\nTwo new members were added to the Accessibility Advisory Committee. Ashley Levandier, a Registered Nurse who works as the Diabetes Education Centre Coordinator, Infection Control Staff for St. Ann Community and Nursing Care Centre, and with Continuing Care and Palliative Care, was one of the members councillors approved. \"And has a child who has a disability, so (she) has first-hand knowledge of that as well,\" Warden Amanda Mombourquette said. The second person to join the committee was Shelley Dorey, Director of the Small Options Home in Arichat. \"She supports individuals with special needs, on a daily basis, and has worked for the ROC Society for about 10 years in the past as well, and is very passionate about helping people be successful,\" noted the warden. In response to a question from Deputy Warden Melanie Sampson, Mombourquette said there are about 10 members of the committee. \"The goal is that we want 50 per cent, or more, of people on that committee, either with lived experience, or who worked for an organization that cares for people with disabilities,\" she replied. \"If you do know of anyone with lived experience, please, please talk to them about considering participating because it is a really great committee and important work to be done there. I think the more voices we have, of people who are living with disabilities every day, that's important; we want those folks to be in the driver's seat making decisions.\"\n\nTo honour National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, council approved a motion to hold an annual flag raising ceremony on the last business day before Sept. 30.\n###\n\nWrite a list format summary of the council motions in at least 5 bulleted points for local residents.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMunicipality of the County of Antigonish took the lead on the project.\nMunicipalities fighting for better high-speed internet access.\nRequest that a staff member and councillor be assigned a position on the Offshore Wind Task Force and Point Tupper Energy Development Committee.\nProvide $669 to ACTing Collectively for a mail-out to seniors.\nExplore funding opportunities and contact the Louisdale Lions Club concerning their request for washrooms at the group's recreation facilities.\u00bb\u00bb",

And on this night, a puck on McCarren's stick was a problem for John Jay.\n\nMcCarren buried a shot after that pass for a power play goal, one of the senior's four scores as No. 1-ranked Suffern closed out its regular season with a convincing 5-2 win over No. 2 John Jay-Cross River.\n\nSuffern, which will be the top team when the Section 1 Division 1 seedings are announced Thursday, will enter the playoffs with an 18-2 regular-season mark.\n\nJohn Jay-Cross River, now 17-2-1, will be the top seed in D2, the smaller-school division.\n\nTurning point\n\nSuffern, which has perched in the top rankings spot since the preseason, outshot John Jay-CR 13-6 in the first period but found itself knotted 2-2 entering the second period after John Jay's Charlie Oestreicher scored a power play goal with 1:01 left in the first.\n\nBut a John Jay penalty early in the second period -- for roughing in its offensive end -- helped turn the game.\n\nThe penalty occurred with 12:38 left in the second. Burns's goal was disallowed with 12:07 left and McCarren scored with 11:13 left.\n\nAnd the pendulum fully swung in the Mounties' direction just 46 seconds later when John Jay goalie Nick Petrella, who had a strong game, fully committed to trying to stop Jake Leale at the side of his left post but Leale slid the puck across to Ben Katz, who put it into a virtually open net.\n\nPlayer of the game\n\nTop game honors, of course, went to McCarren, who scored Suffern's first, second, third and fifth goals and also did a great job on Suffern's smothering forecheck, which was a huge factor in Suffern outshooting John Jay 47-24.\n\nMcCarren's first goal, which came with 9:31 left in the first period, just 49 seconds after Jack Browne had given John Jay a 1-0 lead, was on a tip redirection of a CJ Olsen shot.\n\nHis fifth came in the third period.\n\nOff an odd-man rush, McCarren took a feed inside the John Jay zone from Ryan Fennell, sidestepped a John Jay defender, deked and scored when John Jay goalie Nick Petrella cheated toward Dylan Foresta, apparently mistakenly anticipating McCarren passing.\n\n\"Tom McCarren is as good as anybody in the state,\" Suffern coach Rob Schelling said. \"If he plays like this (in the playoffs) it's going to make it tough on teams,\"\n\nBy the numbers\n\nOestreicher assisted on Browne's goal and Justin DeLucia and Browne assisted on Oestreicher's.\n\nRyan Schelling and Fennell both had two assists for Suffern and Colin Nolan, Jack Balk, Jake Leale, Foresta, Olsen and Burns had one apiece.\n\nPetrella had 42 saves, his best two of multiple fine stops being a sprawling left-pad save on Katz and a 2-on-1 stop on Wyatt Levy, both in the third period.\n\nSuffern goalie Jared Packman also came up big, particularly with his club short-handed in the third period. He finished with 22 saves.\n\nQuoteables\n\n\"They're aggressive -- like bees on honey on the puck,\" John Jay-CR coach Alex Smith said of Suffern. ... \"They're a top team in the state for a reason. They're fast. They put us on our heels for a bit.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that his club hurt itself taking penalties.\n\nSuffern coach Rob Schelling was pleased with his squad's forecheck, which had been somewhat missing in action when the Mounties fell 3-2 to New Jersey's Delbarton School last week.\n\nHe also liked that Suffern scored soon after its apparent go-ahead goal was waved off, saying that showed a \"lot of resilience.\"\n\nMcCarren said his team, the defending Section 1 D1 champion, will need to take away the middle of the ice and odd-man rushes during the playoffs.\n\nBut, McCarren, who pointed to his team's depth as key to Tuesday's win, said, \"I think right now we're feeling good.\"\n\nYour task is to:\nFrom the text given, extract the number of goals scored in the game.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab5\u00bb\u00bb",
