Here is what really happened.\n\n\"Of course! This is going to be so fun. You should come to my house and work on it with me after school tomorrow,\" I said. It is like she brainwashes me while I am talking! Is she an ALIEN or some kind of paranormal creature?\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds great! Snaptweet me your address later,\" she said getting up and doing that stupid red carpet walk again.\n\n\"Yay! See you there,\" I said, still thinking she brainwashed me or something because no way would I really have said yay.\n\nGreat! \"This day just keeps getting better and better!\" Now I am stuck with a brainwashing alien or paranormal creature coming over in my free time after school. Worse yet my mom has no clue, and I have to give that freak my address! I am sooo DEAD.\n\nWhen I got home from school I headed into my room to do my homework when I overheard my older brother, Marcus, on the phone talking to his girlfriend. I know I probably shouldn't have been doing this, but I had to. So I pushed my homework aside and stuck my head by the doorway of Marcus's room to try to eavesdrop. I really want to know who it is. I looked the other way for a second to make sure no one knew what I was doing. Then I turned back and saw Marcus staring angrily at me.\n\n\"Go away, or I'll tell Mom and Dad what really happened with the detention!\" Marcus said, pushing me into my room.\n\n\"Wait. How do you\u2013?\" I started to say, getting really mad.\n\n\"That's none of your business. Just do what I say!\" Marcus said, smirking.\n\nWhat?!?! How does he know? The only ways he would know is if one he was spying on me or two ... this is sooo hard to say, he read my diary! How dare he have the nerve to read you, Diary! He will blab to Mom and Dad faster than I can say I AM SOOO DOOMED!\n\nI should call Sam to see if her boyfriend knows who Marcus is dating so I can use that against him. \ud83d\ude42 I should call her now.\n\nNO ANSWER?! Come on! You have to be kidding me.\n\nAt dance, I was sitting on the bench waiting for my turn watching people who were so nervous they practically wobbled across the stage.\n\n\"Hey, Taylor,\" my friend Lia and Sophie said in unison, sitting next to me. Lia had dark brown hair and eyes that seemed to change color depending on the lighting. While Sophie had dark brown hair and dark chocolate brown eyes.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said. \"Do you guys know if you got the parts you auditioned for?\"\n\n\"Melinda got both parts,\" Sophie said angrily.\n\n\"Yeah, it's so unfair. She should only get one,\" Lia agreed.\n\n\"Maybe there was a mistake and really she only got one. Plus, she cannot do both parts at once,\" I said, trying to cheer them up.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Lia said, looking at the ground.\n\n\"Oh well,\" Sophie said. \"We will always have next year.\"\n\n\"Next year? Oh well?\" Lia said confused. \"No, not next year. Not oh well. We are going to get her back.\"\n\n\"No, that's not a good idea,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm in,\" Sophie said. \"But how are we going to get her back?\"\n\n\"A prank,\" Lia said with an evil grin. \"Taylor, you in?\"\n\n\"No, this is wrong,\" I said. \"Plus, I don't want her to hate me.\"\n\n\"Chicken!\" Sophie said.\n\n\"Am not!\" I fight back.\n\n\"I hear she is going for the lead, too,\" Lia said. \"If she gets the part, you are left with none, just like us.\"\n\n\"Taylor Quinn?\" my dance teacher, Mrs. Aura, called. \"You are next.\"\n\nI went up on the stage and started the routine. I was nervous, but I wasn't missing any steps and I even wasn't shaking. Even though I didn't have to, I spun up and twirled three times in the air and landed on my perfectly pointed toes like later on in the scene.\n\n\"Very good, Taylor,\" Mrs. Aura said, clapping. \"Last is Melinda.\"\n\nSophie, Lia, and I, watched as Melinda twirled and leaped along the stage. Then that's where I couldn't believe my eyes. Melinda had copied me.\n\n\"Very good, Melinda,\" Mrs. Aura said. \"And the lead role goes to Melinda.

They found after a COVID-19 infection, women carrying boys produced significantly fewer protective antibodies than women carrying girls.\n\n\"If you're pregnant, you're at high risk. I think whether or not you're carrying a boy versus a girl may maybe slightly modifies that risk, but the risk to you is so much higher than a non-pregnant person of your age, and that that will trump everything,\" Dr. Andrea Edlow, one of the study's Co-Authors, said.\n\nDr. Edlow's team found the placenta protecting baby boys gets more revved up and activated when there's an infection during pregnancy, and that leads to inflammation. She said based on what we know from past pandemics, that could have long term health effects for the baby.\n\n\"Including things as extreme as schizophrenia, or things like autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or even subtle learning difficulties in school, like problems with reading and math,\" Dr. Edlow said.\n\nThe study found women carrying boys transferred fewer antibodies to their baby after a COVID-19 infection, making boys potentially less protected after birth. Researchers are still studying whether the baby's sex affects the strength of the COVID-19 vaccine response, but Dr. Edlow said getting the vaccine is the best thing for you and your baby, whether you're having a boy or girl.\n\n\"When moms get vaccinated, their antibody levels are through the roof compared to what they get from natural infection, and so that will definitely result in more being transferred to the baby, and more protection for your baby,\" Dr. Edlow said.\n\nFrom children to adults, males of all ages have been hit harder by COVID-19, and this new research could help explain why.\n\nCopyright 2021 Scripps Media, Inc.

She was imagining the surprise and resentment painted in the eyes of Silvia and Deborah. She liked Luca because he was simple and direct. Clean. Well-bred. For some time she had been noticing she was the object of his attentions, but she felt she could never feel for him the same emotions that Marco aroused in her. It wasn't a sensation under her skin, butterflies in her stomach, a vortex that sucked her in. Luca suggested her a different feeling, partly dictated from maternal instinct, partly by rationality, perhaps even empathy. Her new friend was very similar to her, different from others, he too a possible target of the two crazies. Luca was of Moroccan origins, his skin dark but not too much. He had been born and raised in the capital by foreign parents. He spoke Roman dialect splendidly and dreamed of becoming the goalkeeper of the Italian national football team.\n\n\"So, would you like to come to the game next Sunday? I play on the back of my house.\"\n\n\"I don't know. We'll see. It depends on my parents... if they let me out!\"\n\n\"We play at three, at five you'll be back home. Sure they can't wall you alive. On Sundays we party, and mom makes very good desserts. If you can't come, don't worry. I'll bring some to school so you can taste them. You're gonna lick your chops.\"\n\n\"Luca, I don't know, we'll see...\"\n\nEleonora was answering absently, watching from the corner of an eye her two enemies, who were doing the same from the other side of the classroom. From bench to bench. Insistently.\n\n\"I'll pick you up. I'm a good boy, I swear. I will even take you back home.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. Provided my father agrees, though. And now let's be silent, Mrs. Boschi's coming in.\"\n\nThe morning passed quickly. In the end, going home at lunchtime, in the midst of hurrying passersby and students of Catholic teaching on leave on the cobblestones of Borgo Pio, Eleonora thought that she had exaggerated, that she had worried unnecessarily. Silvia and Deborah, since the sound of the bell, had begun to ignore her as if they didn't even know her. They had made themselves invisible. Leaving the school, they had walked away without even a glance. So, the threats of the previous day would not be repeated. At least for now.\n\n\"They must have resigned\", she immediately wrote to Chicca, who answered with a terse, \"Be careful anyway. Don't trust them.\"\n\nEleonora quickly changed topic. She wanted to convince herself that she had worried unnecessarily, and basked in the conversation with her friend. The hours she spent chatting with her favourite confidante, or rather with her only confidante, were the best of her days in Rome. Had she been in Milan, she would have gone straight at Chicca's. In Rome, instead, she had to live in that precarious balance of moods and situations, studying and talking to the computer as if it were a person in flesh and bones. She had to go on, she repeated. Going on meant putting a good face on things, attending with enthusiasm the dance class, keeping studying with passion. After all, for everyone in class she was simply the swot, and nobody, except for Luca, wanted anything to do with her.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nWhat type of school is this reference text set in?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe reference text is set in a public school.\u00bb\u00bb",

Ulrich, returning from the hunt, was set upon by the men of Locharnoch; and though he gave good account of himself (for although gray and stiff of limb, he had been in youth a mighty man, and was still a hard man with the axe), the dell-wights were many, and well-armed; and at length, though nigh on a score of the landless lay dead, all of his ghillies had fallen in a butcher's bight around him; and he stood at bay, bleeding from many wounds. And though he staggered, weak and with the wine of his life puddling at his feet, yet still he called out to his foes, damning them for cowards, and daring them to come them within reach of his hand, that he might settle them.\n\nAnd at this one did come forward, a man hooded and cloaked; and beneath the hood was the grinning, tooth-rotted visage of his sworn enemy, Palta\u010d, Lord S\u00f8by.\n\n\"I see thee, mine enemy, through the red mist of midnight,\" quoth the Count. \"Come thou and see me equal clear, traitor and coward, and let us dance the dance of life together.\"\n\n\"Dog of Bellehaine,\" replied his foe, \"I would not stoop to answer thee in kind. Handstrokes are for the half-witted; only fools debate with swords when swords can be hired, and the lowest wretch of a bowman is made by his shaft the equal to a king. Fie on thy challenge; thou shalt die at the hands of the least of my men; and all thy kindliness and courage shall be as dust, and vain.\"\n\n\"Courage lives on beyond death, and so death holds no horror for me,\" retorted Bellehaine. \"Do me but one service, in gratitude for thy ill-won victory: take my body back to my wife, and leave her quits; for in spilling my blood, thou hast ended our quarrel.\"\n\n\"Thinkst thou so, old man?\" said Palta\u010d, laughing. \"Our quarrel is quits when thou and all thy kin are blood-drawn and bare-boned, and thy spirits wail despairing against the corundum confinement of the Long Hall. As for thy wife, happily will I grant thee thy dying wish. But in this wise only: thy trunkless head shall look on as I take her for my own; aye, and all my men too, before she joins thee in the pit.\"\n\n\"Thou mayest kill me, foresworn wretch,\" Bellehaine said in turn, \"but if thou wouldst take council of a dying man, take mine: save thou thy life, and brave not my lady in her lair. For she is a woman of the Hejlaggr.\"\n\n\"What care I?\" quoth felon S\u00f8by. \"She is yet a woman, and so shall bend, beg and break like any other.

Paramount is estimating the film to hit $151 million domestically by the end of the four-day holiday weekend in the North American market.\n\nParamount focused on a global marketing campaign for the film's launch, bringing Top Gun back into the culture over 35 years after the release of the original. The studio activated innovative digital signage campaigns across several major cities, including a Top Gun: Maverick branded takeover of Dubai's Burj Khalifa. The studio hosted several high-profile premiere screenings of the film, including a first-look at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, and premiere events in San Diego, Mexico City, Cannes, London, and Japan.\n\nThe strategy paid off with a $124 million international debut that is 28% ahead of 2018's Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, making Top Gun: Maverick the highest-grossing opener of Tom Cruise's career. For Paramount, Top Gun: Maverick is the studio's second-highest live-action global opening weekend of all-time behind 2014's Transformers: Age of Extinction.\n\nThe United Kingdom led all overseas markets with a $19.4 million bow from 735 locations, more than twice the amount earned by Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, representing the biggest opening weekend for a Tom Cruise film and the biggest live action Paramount title.

Maugham dedicated the publication to his friend Messmore Kendall.\n\nThe play, written as three acts, is unique within the total of Maugham's list of 24 plays, in that he changed from his previous methodology of using the naturalistic speech pattern he had been so well known for, to experiment with a more literary dialogue. Despite being a commercial success, Maugham did not repeat the experiment of literary dialogue again in any of his future plays.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Sacred Flame is the story about the misfortune of Maurice Tabret, previously a soldier of World War I who had returned home unscathed to marry his sweetheart Stella. Unfortunately, after only a year of marriage, Maurice is involved in a plane crash and left crippled from the waist down. The play commences some years later in Gatley House near London, home of Maurice's mother, Mrs. Tabret.\n\nMrs. Tabret's home has been set up to care for her son and a young Nurse Wayland has been Maurice's constant aid throughout. She is extremely professional and devoted to her job. Maurice's wife Stella lives with them also and remains his cheerful companion and support. Maurice's brother Colin Tabret has returned from a time in Guatemala to spend the previous 11 months before the play's start with his brother and the family. The local practitioner Dr. Harvester visits frequently to check on Maurice's condition and to prescribe appropriate treatments. Mrs. Tabret's own husband has passed on some time ago and whilst she does not have a close relationship with anyone else, her old friend retired Major Liconda visits often.\n\nAll is as well as can be expected until Maurice is found dead in his bed one morning. Not altogether unexpected, Dr. Harvester is prepared to write the death certificate but then Nurse Wayland cries foul and indicates that she believes Maurice was murdered by being given an overdose of his sleeping draught. The play then works through a series of Agatha Christie-style \"whodunnit\" scenes as the audience attempt to figure out whether Maurice was killed, took his own life, or else if the whole thing is no more than an imagining and false accusation by the Nurse.\n\nFor the majority of the second and third act the main suspect is Stella, who it transpires is having an affair with Colin and is pregnant by him. It looks as if the matter will be brought to the coroner and the police, which is likely to mean Stella going on trial for Maurice's murder. At the end of the third act, Mrs. Tabret reveals that it was she that killed Maurice. She had realised that Stella was pregnant, and because Stella's love was all that Maurice lived for, she couldn't bear to see Stella's betrayal exposed. Mrs. Tabret therefore sees her act as a mercy killing.\n\nAfter this revelation, the play ends as Nurse Wayland asks Dr. Harvester to sign the death certificate indicating that Maurice died of natural causes, meaning there will be no police investigation.\n\nProductions\n\nThe Sacred Flame premiered November 19, 1928, at Henry Miller's Theatre in New York City. Gilbert Miller directed the three-act drama, which he co-produced with Messmore Kendall. The play closed December 10, 1928, after 24 performances by the following cast:\n\n Anthony Bushell as Colin Tabret\n Clare Eames as Nurse Wayland\n Hubert Harben as Major Liconda\n Robert Harris as Maurice Tabret\n Mary Jerrold as Mrs. Tabret\n Eva Leonard-Boyne as Alice\n Stanley Logan as Dr. Harvester\n Casha Pringle as Stella Tabret\n\nThe play was produced in London in February 1929, featuring Gladys Cooper in the role of Stella and Mary Jerrold as Mrs Tabret.\n\nRevivals\nIn 1966 a major production was presented in the West End starring Gladys Cooper, this time in the role of Mrs Tabret, alongside Wendy Hiller and Leo Genn. There were no major productions between 1967 and 2012, when English Touring Theatre presented a new production for a UK tour.\n\nAdaptations\nIn 1929 Hollywood studio Warner Brothers adapted it as an early sound film The Sacred Flame, followed by a German-language version. In 1935 the studio remade the play as The Right to Live starring Colin Clive and George Brent.\n\nRadio\n Radio version with Sybil Thorndike, Jill Balcon, Carleton Hobbs, BBC radio, 17 July 1965.\n\nTelevision\n The play was broadcast live, BBC Television, Tuesday 13 March 1951\n A version broadcast on BBC Sunday Night Theatre, 10 July 1955\n<end of reference>\nWrite a list format summary of the key details of the play The Sacred Flame in at least 5 bulleted points for medical students.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab\u2022 Setting: The play takes place in Gatley House near London, where Maurice Tabret's mother, Mrs. Tabret, cares for him and a young Nurse Wayland has been his constant aid throughout.\n\n\u2022 Plot: The play begins with Maurice being involved in a plane crash and becoming paralyzed from the waist down.\n\n\u2022 Characters: The main characters are Maurice Tabret, his wife Stella, his brother Colin, Nurse Wayland, Dr. Harvester, Mrs. Tabret, and Major Liconda.\n\n\u2022 Theme: The play deals with themes of love, betrayal, and sacrifice.\n\n\u2022 Ending: The play ends with Mrs. Tabret revealing that she killed Maurice because she couldn't bear to see Stella's betrayal exposed.\u00bb\u00bb",

Lizzie and me closed her eyes, and Lizzie has been a great comfort all night, miss; I'll say that for her. And the doctor have written to mistress's lawyer. I'm not aware that mistress had any near relations to be communicated with, but you know better than I do.\"\n\n\"No,\" says Pansy; \"her husband had a cousin, I believe, but he emigrated. She often said she was without relations. Oh, it cannot be true. Let me go to her.\"\n\nIt is not till Pansy stands beside the bed and kisses the calm, cold brow that she realizes the end has come indeed to the life so lately garlanded with every comfort and pleasure that wealth can bring.\n\nOnly a few hours ago the lips that are silent spoke of summers and winters yet to come, of enjoyable trips in Switzerland, of a new plan of lighting and warming the beautiful villa designed for the residence abroad. Now through all these plans and schemes God has struck eternal silence. The tears fall like rain from Pansy's wistful eyes, and a solemn whisper seems to reach her heart beside that bed: \"Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.\"\n\n\"Do come and take some refreshment, madam. You really must not neglect yourself. So much will fall upon you now that you owe a duty to your constitution, and you had better let me assist you to lie down, and bring you up a little luncheon to your room.\" Mrs. Adair's lady's maid, always obsequious, is doubly so this morning, and her manner, as she draws Pansy solicitously from that quiet room, reminds the girl what a different position is her own henceforth. She has not the slightest doubt that her guardian, who outpoured upon her so much affection, has bequeathed to her this fair inheritance. She is mistress of Silverbeach, of the beautiful home she has learnt to love, and all its costly possessions.\n\nBut she stands alone in the world, for the courtesies of her numerous acquaintances cannot comfort or rest her heart. It is natural that her wistful thoughts should go out at this hour to the aunt who gave her up so patiently to a brighter, grander life. She will seek out poor Aunt Piper, and install her somewhere in plenty and comfort. What a welcome will be hers when she enters Polesheaton again, and goes quietly into the post office and twines her arms around Aunt Temperance, whose heart, she knows, has room for her still.\n\nThe days that follow are busy ones for Pansy. Everyone seems to acknowledge her as mistress and head, and Lady Grace Summit tells her of a very expensive and much sought-after lady companion connected with the aristocracy, who for suitable remuneration might be induced to reside at Silverbeach. Mr. Traylon, the solicitor, is much at the Manor, and makes arrangements for that solemn ceremony wherein he and the doctor and the clergymen are mourners, and which is complimented by a string of empty carriages representing the sorrowing of various families of repute around.\n\nPansy is a little surprised to see Marlow Holme amid the people near the grave. He stands there with uncovered head, listening reverently to the service, but he makes no attempt to intrude himself on her notice, though he sends her a few lines of heartfelt sympathy.\n\nAfter the funeral, the contents of Mrs. Adair's will are made known in private to Pansy. Most people look upon her as mistress of Silverbeach as truly as was its departed owner, but Mr. Traylon and Pansy and one or two others are aware that the inheritance has not been bequeathed unconditionally. It is absolutely forfeited if Pansy has any voluntary communication with \"Miss Temperance Piper, her former guardian.\" So run the terms of Mrs. Adair's last will, made some time ago, and perhaps repented of in that last hour when selfishness and earthly distinctions fade away for ever. But the will was made at a time when Mrs. Adair was resolute that her adopted child should belong to herself and to Silverbeach, and never disgrace her wealth and education by a return to her former sphere of life or recognition of common friends.\n\n\"Do you agree to this sole condition, Miss Adair?\" asks Mr. Traylon, quietly. \"In the event of your refusal to do so, Silverbeach passes to the family of Mr.\n\"\"\"\nWho is Mrs. Adair? What is her relationship to Pansy? Why does she have a will that prohibits Pansy from contacting her former guardian? What happens if Pansy violates this condition?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMrs. Adair is the deceased owner of the beautiful villa that Pansy has inherited. Mrs. Adair is Pansy's adoptive mother. Mrs. Adair's will states that if Pansy violates the condition and contacts her former guardian, she forfeits her inheritance.\u00bb\u00bb",

In 1982, Higgins had a top 40 album with Just Another Day in Paradise. It spawned the hit song \"Key Largo\", which referenced the Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film of the same name and reached No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No. 50 on the Billboard Country chart.\n\nEarly career\nHiggins was born in Tarpon Springs, Florida, United States, and is of Portuguese, Irish and German descent. He once supported himself as a sponge diver, and began his career in show business at the age of twelve as a ventriloquist. He won prizes in local talent contests and became a favorite at school assemblies around Tampa Bay, Florida. Higgins has stated that he is related to German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nHiggins' first band played proms, homecoming dances, and sock hops. After graduating Tarpon Springs High School, Higgins enrolled in St. Petersburg College to study journalism and fine art. He eventually left college and became a drummer for the Tommy Roe band and The Roemans, and played alongside such groups as The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys.\n\nTiring of the rigors of the road and yearning to make his own musical statement, Higgins left The Roemans and returned home to Florida. He put down his drumsticks, picked up a guitar and began crafting music and lyrics. Music producers such as Bob Crewe, Phil Gernhard, and Felton Jarvis took an interest in him and contributed to the growth of the young songwriter. Higgins' talent flourished and he was in demand to play venues throughout the state. During this period, he also met and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of actor\/director Burt Reynolds, who saw Higgins' writing potential and tutored him in screenwriting.\n\nMusic career\nIn 1980, Higgins moved to Atlanta and met record producer Sonny Limbo. He arranged a meeting between Higgins and music publisher Bill Lowery, whom Higgins had known through Tommy Roe. Higgins had been working on a song about a failed romance and presented the rough cut to Lowery and Limbo. They helped him perfect the lyrics of the song that became \"Key Largo\" Higgins recorded the master and presented it to Kat Family Records, a newly formed CBS\/Sony distributing company. After an initial rejection, Kat Family agreed to release the single. The song eventually landed in the Billboard pop charts at number eight, and in the Billboard adult contemporary charts it reached number one.  It also charted in the Billboard country chart. On the strength of the song's success, an album was released titled Just Another Day in Paradise. Other singles followed, such as \"Just Another Day in Paradise\", \"Casablanca\", and \"Pirates and Poets\", but none matched the success domestically of his breakout hit. (The song \"Casablanca\" went on to become a major hit in the Pacific Rim countries, and \"Key Largo\" reached number one status in Canada, Australia and other countries internationally.)\n\nFor the past several years, Higgins and his band have toured extensively around the globe, and he continues to tour on a regular basis in the Pacific Rim and domestically.\n\nLater years\nHiggins has served on the Board of Governors of the Atlanta Chapter of the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for several years. Besides maintaining a rigorous schedule of one-nighters, he also makes regular appearances on the Las Vegas strip.\n\nIn recent years, Higgins has moved into film production with his sons Julian and Aaron, producing Beast Beneath (distributed by Entertainment One), 2009's Poker Run (also distributed by Entertainment One) and 2012's The Colombian Connection, starring Tom Sizemore and \"Christmas in Hollywood\".\n\nLegacy\nHe was inducted into the Florida Music Hall of Fame with a lifetime achievement award in January 2016 along with Jimmy Buffett, Julio Iglesias and Tom Petty. In 2019 he was also inducted in the Florida Artists Hall of Fame along with such notables as Ernest Hemingway.\n\nJazz vocalist Nancy Wilson recorded a version of the Bertie Higgins original song \"Casablanca\" for EMI Records.\n\nIn 2009, \"Key Largo\" was ranked No. 75 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s.\n\nHis die-hard fans are known to be called \"Boneheads\".\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nMusic videos\n\nWrite a short biography of Bertie Higgins for a general audience.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAmerican singer-songwriter Bertie Higgins was born in Tarpon Springs, Florida, in 1944.

It has Arizona taking Thomas with the No. 3 selection.\n\nRandy Gurzi wrote: \"This offseason wasn't handled very well by the Arizona Cardinals decision-makers. After giving up on Steve Wilks following just one season, they hired a coach in Kliff Kingsbury who just had a losing record at Texas Tech. Even with that being the case, he had other suitors and is a well-respected offensive mind. He was also a huge fan of Kyler Murray. Arizona ended up taking Murray first overall this season, which was expected considering Kingbury's fondness for the Heisman Trophy winner. What wasn't expected was the way they danced around the subject and left Josh Rosen hanging all year long \u2014 and even claimed he was their guy at times. Rosen was finally sent to the Miami Dolphins, where he will try and get his career rolling. As weird as it all was when going down, the Cards did end up landing a pretty impressive draft haul, especially on offense. Murray will have Hakeem Butler, Andy Isabella and KeeSean Johnson joining him. Those players, as well as Christian Kirk's presence, make the future look bright in the desert, as long as they can keep Murray from being beaten up. That's why they go for an offensive lineman here in Andrew Thomas. Currently, Thomas is fighting for the right to be the first tackle taken in the draft and he does just that in our 2020 NFL Mock Draft.\"\n\nDraft Tek has the Cardinals going with edge rusher A.J. Epenesa out of Iowa with the No. 4 pick in the 2020 NFL draft.\n\nIt wrote: \"The Cards have improved in the eyes of DraftTek's power rankers since last month, moving from the top pick down to the #4. While the team entertained drafting Nick Bosa in 2019 (until Kyler Murray came sashaying by), they will have the opportunity to draft an elite EDGE defender in the 2020 NFL Draft should they finish in the bottom 5, as predicted at this moment. While GM Steve Kiem added T-Sizzle to join sackmaster Chandler Jones, Sizzle is a soon-to-fizzle 37 years old. Adding to a strength seems an anathema to effective draft strategy, but it's done often enough when the talent justifies it, as Chase Young and A.J. Epenesa could do. Have the Cowboys ever turned down an elite offensive lineman despite regularly sporting one of the leagues best OLs?\"\n\nNBC Sports has Arizona getting the No. 5 pick in the 2020 NFL draft and taking LSU safety Grant Delpit with that selection.\n\nBen Standig wrote: \"The Cardinals scooped up D.J.

Today, I often hear from my cousin; he and his wife are very supportive of my ministry.\n\nDoes 2 Corinthians 5:17 mean that we will not have to face the consequences of our past behavior? While it is true that in God's eyes we are white as snow, we still must face our past. We will have problems carried over from past sins. However, the way we look at those problems, our desire to deal with those problems, and the problems themselves (which no longer look insurmountable) will become new! We no longer have to deal with those problems on our own. Our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. In Christ, we can do all things. We face our problems in the light of God's Word, and if God be for us, who can be against us? I am convinced that 2 Corinthians 5:17 means exactly what it says: Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\n\nFounder's Note 11, Step 2:\n\nI wrote earlier about being born physically alive but spiritually dead. To help explain this, we can compare ourselves to computers. Being physically alive, information is being downloaded to us through our five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). We then process this information, and we make decisions based upon what we have processed. For example, because of what I have learned from my senses, if I see a fire, I walk around it and not through it. This information is constantly being downloaded to us and processed by the brain, which results in decisions being made and action being taken or not taken. However, it is true that there are more things unseen than seen. For example, a simple chair has molecules holding it together. There are atoms with protons and neutrons. Gravity is holding that chair in place. I cannot see these things, but they exist. I cannot see a cold virus, but I know it exists. I cannot see the vast expanse of the universe, but I know it is out there. The bottom line is that nothing is as simple as it seems.\n\nEvery human being has a spiritual part, which is a connection that needs to be plugged in to the Spirit of God in order for us to understand things that exist in the spiritual realm. Once we get plugged in, the Holy Spirit starts downloading information and light that illuminates things that were previously in the dark. As a result, we have better and more complete information upon which to base our decisions. The more information we have, the better decisions we will be able to make, and the results of those decisions will be better, too. So how do we get spiritually plugged in? We get spiritually plugged in when we receive the Holy Spirit. This happens when we put our faith and trust in Jesus.\n\n* * *\n\n http:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/restore?s=t.\nStep 3\n\nDecide\n\nI have decided to turn from the things of the past (repent) and to ask   \nJesus to be lord and manager of my life (surrender).\n\n(Discuss each Bible verse by asking, \"How does this particular verse apply to Step 3?\")\n\nNote: Unfortunately, many people never complete Step 2. They may even go as far as believing that Jesus is who He said He is, but this is only intellectual knowledge. They see, they believe, but they do not receive. They make the decision that Jesus and Christianity are not for them. There is no repentance. There is no surrender. At the foot of the cross, a transfer of the will must take place. We lay our will down and receive God's will, God's plan, and God's purpose for our lives. What we know to be true in our heads needs to be transferred to our hearts.\n\nTo open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

US 72A crosses the Tennessee River at Decatur, along with U.S. Highway 31, and follows the entire route of Interstate 565. SR-20 was co-signed with US\u00a072A from Muscle Shoals to Huntsville but has since been truncated to the junction of I-65 just east of Decatur.\n\nOriginally, US\u00a072A turned off SR-20 on to SR-53 \/ Jordan Lane in Huntsville and followed it north  to rejoin with US\u00a072. With the completion of I-565 in the early 1990s, US\u00a072A was routed along with I-565 to the termination of I-565 at US\u00a072 at Chapman Mountain.\n\nRoute description\nUS\u00a072 Alt. begins at an intersection with US\u00a043\/US\u00a072 in Muscle Shoals.

The road continues over the \"Steamboat Bill\" Hudson Memorial Bridge, offering panoramic views of the river. After crossing the bridge, US 72 Alt. and SR 20 continue east towards I-65 and I-565, while US 31 heads north towards Athens and Calhoun Community College.\n\nAt this point, US 72A merges with I-565, and the two routes run together for the entire length of I-565, passing through Mooresville, Madison, and Huntsville.

I'm usually at my happiest pregnant mood-wise. I feel happier than I do when not pregnant. That's why it's so, so hard for me to come to terms with.\"\n\nChrissy Teigen with husband John Legend and daughter Luna. (SplashNews)\n\nChrissy added that the bleeding never stopped, which led her to go to the hospital. The Cravings author said in the \"simplest of terms\" that her \"placenta is really, really weak,\" which she has revealed previously. Her weak placenta is what forced her to go on bed rest. Chrissy noted that she feels \"really good\" and \"the baby is so healthy, growing stronger than Luna or Miles.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But basically, he is the strongest, coolest dude in the sh*ttiest house. His house is just falling apart. It didn't have a good foundation to begin with\u2026 He didn't have the strongest chance at the very, very beginning.

John was by Chrissy's side and even sweetly made her a ham and cheese sandwich in the hospital.\n\nInstruction:\nWrite a summary of Chrissy Teigen's pregnancy complications and the action steps taken to address them in at least 5 sentences for medical students.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abChrissy Teigen, a 34-year-old celebrity, has been in the hospital for bleeding more than usual during her third pregnancy. Her placenta, which provides the baby with nutrients and oxygen through the umbilical cord, is considered weak by doctors. Bed rest is the best course of action for her and her baby until the danger passes. Her baby is healthy, but the house is falling apart.\u00bb\u00bb",

Why is a strong understanding of this concept so important for successful development strategies?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abA nexus refers to the interconnected nature of the various challenges faced in international development and diplomacy, such as poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, and political instability. It highlights the need for a holistic and integrated approach to addressing these challenges.\n\nA strong understanding of the nexus concept is important for successful development strategies as it emphasizes the interdependencies between different issues and the need for cross-sectoral collaboration to achieve sustainable and equitable solutions. For example, increased investment in renewable energy sources can not only address climate change but also create jobs and reduce energy poverty, while reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Similarly, improving access to education and healthcare can contribute to more stable and prosperous societies, while also reducing poverty and inequality.\n\nThe nexus approach requires a shift in thinking away from siloed approaches and towards a more integrated and systemic perspective on development challenges. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the trade-offs and synergies between different objectives, and the need for evidence-based decision-making and continuous monitoring and evaluation. By adopting a nexus perspective, development practitioners can design more effective and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abThe reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nCell tracking by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a collection of multiple advantages over other imaging modalities, including high spatial resolution, unlimited depth penetration, 3D visualization, lack of ionizing radiation, and the potential for long-term cell monitoring. Three decades of innovation in both contrast agent chemistry and imaging physics have built an expansive array of probes and methods to track cells non-invasively across a diverse range of applications. In this review, we describe both established and emerging MRI cell tracking approaches and the variety of mechanisms available for contrast generation. Emphasis is given to the advantages, practical limitations, and persistent challenges of each approach, incorporating quantitative comparisons where possible. Toward the end of this review, we take a deeper dive into three key application areas \u2013 tracking cancer metastasis, immunotherapy for cancer, and stem cell regeneration \u2013 and discuss the cell tracking techniques most suitable to each.\n\nIn vivo, cell tracking refers to monitoring the localization, survival, migration, and growth of cells in a living subject via a non-invasive technology such as imaging. This capability is especially valuable in applications that involve the administration of therapeutic cells \u2013 most notably, immune cell therapy for cancer patients or stem cell therapy to regenerate healthy tissue. Once cells are introduced inside the body, their fate is influenced by a myriad of factors. Massive cell death is inevitable, but the surviving population varies greatly, depending on the cell type, injection mode, and the host tissue environment into which cells are introduced. In many instances, therapeutic cells are also expected to be home to a certain location, such as immune cells to a tumor, or to distribute evenly over a larger tissue volume. In stem cell applications, cells may be expected to differentiate and proliferate to create new tissue or repair an injury. Unfortunately, the number of surviving cells, migration to the desired therapeutic target, and extent of cell proliferation have been inconsistent, dependent partly on the patient and manufacturing process, and can only be monitored by a non-invasive cellular imaging technique. Cell tracking is an acknowledged, critical enabler in the development and eventual clinical translation of cell therapy.\n\nNon-invasive cell-tracking is possible using a handful of imaging modalities \u2013 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and optical methods. Yet, none has emerged as a front-runner due to the inherent shortcomings that accompany the unique, modality-specific advantages. For example, optical methods offer the most versatility for labeling and visualizing cells, but limited tissue penetration constraints application to superficial tissue and small organisms such as mice. PET tracers provide exquisite sensitivity, but cellular toxicity from radiolabeling, tracking over hours instead of days, and poor spatial resolution severely dampens its appeal in humans. MRI for cell tracking suffers from low sensitivity but, otherwise, overcomes the limitations described above and can visualize cells with unlimited depth penetration and high spatial resolution. In this review, we examine both established and emerging MRI approaches for tracking cells in vivo, giving particular emphasis to the hurdles and successes intrinsic to each approach when implemented in practice. Table 2 summarizes the key points of consideration for each MRI cell labeling and tracking technique discussed in this review.\n\nCreate a basic paraphrase of the text keeping the original meaning the same in 1-2 paragraphs that is easy to skim.

Researchers have estimated that, on average, a black, unarmed person is at least as likely to be shot by police as someone who is white and armed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, police shootings often lead to significant ruptures in police-community trust, contributing to cycles of community violence. When community members feel they cannot rely on law enforcement or the justice system to keep them safe or treat them fairly, witness participation with law enforcement drops, and a small fraction of the population seeks retaliatory vigilante justice instead.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve in 2008, Robbie Tolan parked outside his family\u2019s home of 15 years, located in a majority-white neighborhood. Robbie and his cousin Anthony, two young Black men, exited the car and were approaching the house when a voice in the dark cried out, \u201cGet on the ground, now!\u201d\n\nSadly, this is a scenario that Black and Brown parents fear and prepare their children to face: young Black men and boys are 21 times more likely to be shot in their interactions with law enforcement than young white men and boys.\n\nRobbie and Anthony complied with the instructions of the officer, who believed the car was stolen (it was not). A second officer arrived on the scene, and the commotion drew out Robbie\u2019s parents, who tried to convince the officers that nothing illegal had occurred.\n\nThe police officers instructed Robbie\u2019s dad to stand next to the police car. When his mother stepped in to calm things down, an officer violently slammed her against the garage door. Acting on instinct, Robbie jumped to his feet to come to her aid and was shot three times in the chest.\n\nRobbie Tolan survived his encounter with the police, but many are not so lucky to live to tell their stories.\n\nThe history of policing and its relationship to Black and Brown communities in this country is complex and fraught. A generational lack of faith in law enforcement keeps many Americans from actively engaging with their police forces. This deeply ingrained mistrust is reinforced with every instance of police brutality.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nTake excerpts from the article about actual police officer shooting statistics and create a chart with a bulleted list.

These can include woodlands, mountainous regions, desert, jungle and at sea. Operations may involve finding people on foot, as well as aircraft and vessels that are in distress.\n\nPlatforms, Sensors &amp; Payloads\n\nCombat and military SAR is often undertaken using helicopters and manned aircraft, as well as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). They may be equipped with a range of different sensors, including EO\/IR imaging sensors for daytime and nighttime operations, as well as WAMI (wide-area motion imagery) systems which have an extended field of view and can image large areas of land or water at once.\n\nMilitary SAR aircraft and helicopters may also be equipped with searchlights that can be configured to operate in different conditions such as fog and sea spray, and be compatible with night vision goggles (NVG). They may be able to drop essential items such as life rafts. Combat SAR platforms may also carry weapons and defensive capabilities.\n\nMilitary personnel may carry certain items that can improve their chances of being found in a search and rescue situation. These items include locator beacons as well as specially designed survival radios that provide encrypted two-way communications and broadcast GPS locations.\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the article, extract the equipment that SAR platforms have for the combat search and rescue team in a bullet list format, such as:\n\u2014{SAR equipment} | {Brief description}\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab\u2014SAR equipment | Brief description\n\u2014EO\/IR imaging sensors | For daytime and nighttime operations.\n\u2014WAMI systems | Extended field of view.\n\u2014Searchlights | Configurable for different conditions.\n\u2014Night vision goggles (NVG) compatible.\n\u2014Life rafts | Essential items.\n\u2014Survival radios | Two-way encrypted communications.\n\u2014GPS locations | Broadcast GPS locations.\u00bb\u00bb",

This theory is backed up by the fact Didymos appears to have a spinning-top-like shape, and it appears to be clear of loose boulders at its surface.\n\nAnother risk, if astronauts could walk on the surface of an asteroid, would be encountering a solid surface or if they would sink beneath its surface. When NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission visited the asteroid Bennu in 2020, a video of its landing showed a leg of the lander touching down too hard and almost sinking. This is because Bennu is a rubble pile asteroid so loosely packed that it resembles a child's ball pit.\n\n\"A lot depends on whether its material is hard or soft, which would determine how high an astronaut might bounce or else sink,\" Director of Research at Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur, Patrick Michel, said in ESA's statement. \"On the asteroid Bennu, visited by NASA's OSIRIS-REx, you would clearly sink if you landed too hard.\"\n\nAnother risk faced by a human astronaut aiming to walk on an asteroid would be how they adhere to the asteroid's surface. We don't tend to worry too much about this on Earth as our planet's gravity keeps our feet on the ground. For a body with much less mass, the gravity may not be enough to stop astronauts from losing their footing permanently. For instance, the gravity of Dimorphos is less than a millionth that of Earth. Patrick said just 6 cm per second of upward motion might be enough to send an astronaut into orbit around the asteroid they are exploring.\n\n\"Jump too fast, and you might never come down again because you could exceed the local escape velocity,\" Naomi added. \"Plus, in the ultra-low gravity environment, it would be easy to generate significant ground motion, potentially triggering an avalanche of rocks.\"\n\nBased on the document provided, brainstorm at least one potential solution that would allow astronauts to safely and efficiently visit an asteroid without touching the surface.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abOne potential solution that could allow astronauts to safely and efficiently visit an asteroid without touching the surface is the use of robotic rovers. These rovers could be equipped with various tools and sensors to gather data and samples from the asteroid's surface, allowing astronauts to study the asteroid's composition and structure from a distance. This would minimize the risk of astronauts losing their footing or encountering solid surfaces, and would also reduce the risk of contaminating the asteroid's surface with Earthly bacteria. Additionally, robotic rovers could be used to explore areas of the asteroid that are too treacherous or unstable for human exploration. This would allow scientists to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the asteroid's geology and history without risking human life.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nIn 1922, The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America was formed, where Hollywood studios formed a trade association. By 1945, this association was renamed to the current, The Motion Picture Association of America. Although the censorship laws have changed a bit over the years, they basically have the same system for rating motion pictures. Groups who wanted to protect their children from mature content in movies established the rating system for movies in 1968. Originally there were four ratings for movies, but now there are five, which include: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. Each rating is determined by the amount of adult content in the movie. The G rating on a movie stands for General Audience, which means the movie contains no nudity, sexual content, strong language or drug usage. Although there is still violence in G rated movies, it is minimal. A PG rated movie stands for Parental Guidance is suggested. Some content in a PG movie may not be suitable for children. PG-13 is a rating that strongly cautions parents about the adult content of this film. This rating was added in 1984 to show that the film had enough language, violence or sexual content for some parents to find inappropriate. The R rating on this system stands for restricted, meaning that no one under the age of 17 without a parent or guardian is permitted to watch that movie. The last on the system is NC-17, which means that no one under the age of 17 is permitted to watch the movie, because of the intense adult content the movie has.\n\nThe next board is the FCC, the board who has become infamous for censoring music on the radio. Censoring music isn't all the FCC does, according to the official FCC website, \"The FCC is barred by law from trying to prevent the broadcast of any point of view. The Communications Act prohibits the FCC from censoring broadcast material, in most cases, and from making any regulation that would interfere with freedom of speech. Expressions of views that do not involve a \"clear and present danger of serious substantive evil\" come under the protection of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\" The FCC censors any type of media sent out through the airwaves, whether it be television stations, radio waves, or anything put on a compact disc. The FCC has been trying to censor one of my favorite television shows, South Park, for almost 15 years now, until in 2001, they allowed the television show to push the envelope and say the word \"shit\" over one hundred and sixty times in a single episode. Since then, many other shows have slowly been putting more and more controversial content in their television shows and radio stations.\n\nThe last board is the ESRB. The ESRB is in charge of rating video games and mobile apps based on adult content. Unlike movies, games are released to the public before they are tested by the ESRB. How are the video games processed? Game companies, after completing a game will fill out a long questionnaire about the game it's content, bonus materials, language, controlled substances and sexual content featured within the game. After the questionnaire is complete, the companies must send in a DVD with pertinent content on it, including game play, missions\/quests, and cut scenes, along with the most extreme instances of any relevant content. According to the ESRB official website, \"All games rated in this manner are tested by ESRB shortly after they become publicly available to ensure that appropriate ratings have been assigned. In the event content was not fully or accurately disclosed by the publisher, either the rating displayed in the store will be promptly corrected or, in egregious cases, the game may be removed from the store.\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the text, extract the current rating systems used for movies, music and video games. Include the following information:\n\n1. Name of the rating system\n2. Number of ratings in the system\n3. Description of the system\n4.

The movie \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" is an example of a PG-13 movie. It contains some violence, but it is minimal.\n\n2. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\n3. The FCC is not allowed to prevent the broadcast of any point of view. The Communications Act prohibits the FCC from censoring broadcast material, in most cases, and from making any regulation that would interfere with freedom of speech.\n\n3.
