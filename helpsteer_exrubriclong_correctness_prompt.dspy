Today, I often hear from my cousin; he and his wife are very supportive of my ministry.\n\nDoes 2 Corinthians 5:17 mean that we will not have to face the consequences of our past behavior? While it is true that in God's eyes we are white as snow, we still must face our past. We will have problems carried over from past sins. However, the way we look at those problems, our desire to deal with those problems, and the problems themselves (which no longer look insurmountable) will become new! We no longer have to deal with those problems on our own. Our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. In Christ, we can do all things. We face our problems in the light of God's Word, and if God be for us, who can be against us? I am convinced that 2 Corinthians 5:17 means exactly what it says: Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\n\nFounder's Note 11, Step 2:\n\nI wrote earlier about being born physically alive but spiritually dead. To help explain this, we can compare ourselves to computers. Being physically alive, information is being downloaded to us through our five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). We then process this information, and we make decisions based upon what we have processed. For example, because of what I have learned from my senses, if I see a fire, I walk around it and not through it. This information is constantly being downloaded to us and processed by the brain, which results in decisions being made and action being taken or not taken. However, it is true that there are more things unseen than seen. For example, a simple chair has molecules holding it together. There are atoms with protons and neutrons. Gravity is holding that chair in place. I cannot see these things, but they exist. I cannot see a cold virus, but I know it exists. I cannot see the vast expanse of the universe, but I know it is out there. The bottom line is that nothing is as simple as it seems.\n\nEvery human being has a spiritual part, which is a connection that needs to be plugged in to the Spirit of God in order for us to understand things that exist in the spiritual realm. Once we get plugged in, the Holy Spirit starts downloading information and light that illuminates things that were previously in the dark. As a result, we have better and more complete information upon which to base our decisions. The more information we have, the better decisions we will be able to make, and the results of those decisions will be better, too. So how do we get spiritually plugged in? We get spiritually plugged in when we receive the Holy Spirit. This happens when we put our faith and trust in Jesus.\n\n* * *\n\n http:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/restore?s=t.\nStep 3\n\nDecide\n\nI have decided to turn from the things of the past (repent) and to ask   \nJesus to be lord and manager of my life (surrender).\n\n(Discuss each Bible verse by asking, \"How does this particular verse apply to Step 3?\")\n\nNote: Unfortunately, many people never complete Step 2. They may even go as far as believing that Jesus is who He said He is, but this is only intellectual knowledge. They see, they believe, but they do not receive. They make the decision that Jesus and Christianity are not for them. There is no repentance. There is no surrender. At the foot of the cross, a transfer of the will must take place. We lay our will down and receive God's will, God's plan, and God's purpose for our lives. What we know to be true in our heads needs to be transferred to our hearts.\n\nTo open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. (Acts 26:18)\n\nQ. Who is me in the above verse?\n\nQ. We do not just receive forgiveness of sins when we turn to Jesus; what else do we receive?\n\nQ. What does an inheritance mean to you?\n\nFor if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. (2 Chronicles 30:9)\n\nNote: For if ye turn again.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat is the context of this passage?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe context of this passage is the conversion of the apostle Paul. Paul is discussing his own conversion in this passage, specifically his experience on the road to Damascus. He is explaining to King Agrippa how he came to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and how that belief transformed his life.\u00bb\u00bb",

Chris says it's wonderful to be able to build on the legacy of the store and be an award winner in such a short period of time.\n\n\"There's a talented team and network here and we're thrilled to be able to carry on and continue to deliver our community with the high-quality service they have come to expect from us.\"\n\nThe judging and decision for the award took place in August when previous owner-operators Damien and Renee Langely were still running the store, however, they are still excited for the new Coromandel team's win.\n\nChris says this was thanks to the value and ethos of Foodstuffs North Island which often feels like one big family. \"No matter which store you're from, we're also a co-operative and that means everyone is there to lend a hand, offer advice or ready to catch up for a yarn.\"\n\nThe awards were held online this time, but Chris says it meant they could celebrate in real-time, in-store. \"The team [was] able to watch live and get involved which built a great atmosphere. It was really special to be a part of it with each other and see the look of excitement and sense of achievement on everyone's faces.\"\n\nAs for next year, Chris is going for a hat-trick for the Coromandel store. \"We'll continue to do what we do best, which is serve our local community and deliver fantastic products at great value and top-quality customer service.

Although she is praised by the audience, her music teacher Rudig feels that she can not be the greatest opera singer in history until she performs in New York City. When she is criticized for not putting her soul into the song, she gets mad, until she suddenly notices a mysterious man walking on the street. She becomes smitten with the man, until Rudig claims that he is a gigolo whose latest client is Marchesa Bianca San Giovanni, a former diva with a notorious past.\n\nLater that night, Nella decides to head to Budapest, accompanied by Rudig, her butler Conrad, her maid Emma and her fianc\u00e9 Count Albert von Gronac, whom she is not in love with. She is shocked when she finds out the mysterious man is on board as well, with the marchesa as his company. Rudig again suggests that she will never be a great singer if she does not experience love. The next day, Rudig announces that Fletcher is in town to sign European artists, an agent for the prestigious Metropolitan Opera in New York. Later that afternoon, she finds out her fianc\u00e9 is having an affair with one of her enemies.\n\nFurious and upset with her love life, she goes to the hotel where she is staying and decides to hire the mysterious man, Jim, in hopes of experience love and thereby impress Fletcher. She is attracted to him, but is afraid to have her as his admirer. Jim, who is actually agent Fletcher, soon finds out that Nella thinks that he is a gigolo. Instead of revealing the truth, he pretends to be one and dominantly forces her to make a decision: spend the night with him or leave within three minutes.\n\nNella decides to spend the night with him, but leaves the next morning before he awakes. That night, she again gives a performance of Tosca, which is acclaimed as her best in her entire career. After returning home, she is overcome by joy to find out that she has landed a contract with the Metropolitan Opera, but feels guilty for what she has done the night before. The same day, Jim visits her, returning the necklace she has left to pay for his services and demanding her to choose between him and the contract. When she tears up the contract, he realizes that she is in love with him and he reveals himself to be a nephew of the marchesa and the famous talent scout. Now, Nella can have the successful New York career she has dreamt of.\n\nCast\nGloria Swanson as Nella Vago\nMelvyn Douglas as Jim Fletcher\nAlison Skipworth as Marchesa Bianca San Giovanni\nFerdinand Gottschalk as Rudig\nRobert Greig as Conrad\nWarburton Gamble as Count Albert von Gronac\nGreta Meyer as Emma\nBoris Karloff as a comical waiter\n\nProduction\nThe film is based on the Hungarian play of the same name, which was performed on Broadway between November 18, 1930, and June 1931. In the film, Melvyn Douglas, Ferdinand Gottschalk, Robert Greig, Greta Meyer and Warburton Gamble recreated their roles they had also played in the play. In June 1931, Adela Rogers St. Johns was assigned to write the screenplay. A month later, she was replaced with Sheridan Gibney, who was eventually replaced as well. According to a January 1931 news article, George Fitzmaurice was initially set to direct, but he was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy. LeRoy as a young unknown had appeared uncredited playing a newsboy in Swanson's 1923 silent societal drama Prodigal Daughters.\n\nJoseph Schenck assigned Gloria Swanson to play the lead role, believing it would help the actress getting out of her career slump. The film was the only of her early talkies in which she did not sing, although ironically playing an opera singer. The film sparked Douglas' screen debut.\n\nThe Hays Code strongly objected to the film and demanded several cuts to be made. The scene which the Code thought to be the most vulgar was the love scene between Nella and Jim. A staff member commented: \"This scene was one of the most offensive, if not the most offensive-in my recollection.\" In 1931, it was allowed to be released, but the request of re-releases in 1935 and 1937 were rejected.\n\nSee also\n Boris Karloff filmography\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nWhat was the critical reception of the film at the time of its release?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abIt was one of the first big-budget productions to come out of Hollywood after the transition from silent films to \"talkies\" and the critical reception was positive. It was also Swanson's biggest box-office success since 1929.\u00bb\u00bb",

Due to a very small population base, the details of storms affecting Arizona during the first half of the 20th century are sketchy at best, and the following list is largely limited to events that have occurred since 1960.\n\n1916 Severe Winter Floods\n\nIn early 1916, the flow on the Gila River around Yuma is estimated to have reached 200,000 cubic feet per second; a record which probably will never be broken as reservoirs on the Gila, Salt, and Verde rivers now greatly reduce the flow at Yuma even during the most serious flooding. Inflation adjusted damage was in the millions of dollars.\n\n1962 Tropical Storm Claudia\n\nSeptember 25 through 27 1962: The remains of Tropical Storm Claudia causes severe flash flooding in and around Tucson.Up to seven inches of rain fell in the desert just west of Tucson near the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum. Flood waters inundated Marana and Sells.\n\n1964 San Xavier Tornado\n\nAugust 27: A tornado hit the San Xavier Mission Village west of Tucson. Two deaths and 9 injuries were reported. Four homes were destroyed.\n\n1965 Heavy Winter Rain and Snow\n\nDecember 1965: Heavy rainfall and melting snow forced a release of water into the Salt River. All roads across the Salt River in metro Phoenix were washed out and all bridges at least partially damaged. Monthly precipitation exceeded 12 inches at several mountain stations.\n\n1967 Storm of the Century - 86 inches of Snow at Flagstaff\n\nDecember 12-20 1967: A huge snow storm paralyzed northern Arizona and brought snow to much of the state. In reality, it was two storms with the second following closely on the heels of the first. During these nine days, 86.0 inches of snow fell at Flagstaff. At Winslow, where average annual snowfall is 11.2 inches, 39.6 inches of snow was reported. On December 14, a state record 38.0 inches fell in 24 hours at the Heber Ranger Station. Snowfall totals over the Rim country included 102.7 inches at Hawley Lake, 99 inches at Greer, 91.5 inches at the Heber Ranger Station, 87.3 inches at Crown King, 77.0 inches at Payson, 46.0 inches at Prescott, 35.2 inches at Sedona, and 31.0 inches at the south rim of the Grand Canyon. The Navajo Nation was extremely hard hit as two to three feet of snow fell across the reservation. Window Rock measured 33.5 inches. People on the reservation were instructed to use ashes from their stoves and fireplaces to write distress signals in the snow that could be spotted from the air. Eight people died of exposure.\n\nSouthern Arizona did not escape the measurable snow as even the lowest deserts saw accumulation. Amounts include 84.0 inches on Mount Lemmon, 27.5 inches at Miami,17.7 inches at Wilcox,11.0 inches at Safford,5.0 inches at Wickenburg,3.8 inches at Douglas,3.0 inches at Ajo, and 1.6 inches at Tucson. And, perhaps the most surprising report of all, 2.5 inches at Gila Bend.\n\n 1970 The Labor Day Storm of 1970 -Tropical Storm Norma\n\nSeptember 4 and 5 1970:The Labor Day storm of 1970. The remains of tropical storm Norma brought severe flooding to Arizona and became the deadliest storm in Arizona history. There were 23 deaths in central Arizona including 14 from flash flooding on Tonto Creek in the vicinity of Kohl's Ranch.Total rainfall at Workman Creek (about 30 miles north of Globe in the Sierra Ancha mountains) was 11.92 inches, with 11.40 inches falling in 24 hours. Other rainfall amounts included 9.09 at Upper Parker Creek, 8.74 at Mount Lemmon, 8.44 at Sunflower, 8.08 at Kitt Peak, 7.12 at the Tonto Creek Fish Hatchery, and 7.01 inches at Crown King.\n\n1971 Tempe Tornado\n\nAugust 30: An F-1 tornado touched down south of Tempe and moved north into the city. Eyewitnesses reported what appeared to be a huge dust devil reaching into the clouds before the tornado struck. An estimated 100 homes were damaged with most of the damage to roofs, windows, and block walls. Very heavy rain and hail accompanied the tornado, and 41 minor injuries were reported due to flying glass. Roof damage to the McClintock High School gymnasium allowed water to pour onto the gymnasium floor causing severe damage.\n\n 1972 Phoenix's Worst Flash Flood\n\nJune 22 1972: Severe flash flooding occurred in metro Phoenix. Three to five inches of rain fell over much of the north half of the Phoenix metro area. Flood waters inundated hundreds of homes in Phoenix and Scottsdale. This is particularly notable because normal June rainfall in Phoenix is only 0.13 inches.\n\n 1972 Hurricane Joanne\n\nOctober 4 through 7 1972: The remains of Hurricane Joanne brought heavy rain and flooding to much of the state. It was the first documented time that a tropical storm reached Arizona with its cyclonic circulation intact. Heavy rains fell over much of the state with severe flooding in the Clifton, Duncan, and Safford areas.\n\n 1976 Hurricane Kathleen\n\nOn September 10 and 11: The remains of Hurricane Kathleen moved across Baja and into southern California near El Centro. With its circulation still intact, tropical storm force winds produced considerable damage in Yuma. Sustained winds exceeded 50 mph, and gusts as high as 76 mph were reported in Yuma. One man was killed as a 75 foot palm tree crashed onto his mobile home. Severe flooding also occurred in Mohave county. Residual moisture brought more severe thunderstorms to the state on September 24 and 25. The Tucson area was particularly hard hit with flash flooding and golf ball sized hail. Hail covered the ground to a depth of 5 inches on Mount Lemmon.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nFrom the text provided, extract only the storms with injuries or deaths.

Graduations, births and deaths were must years. Whether she went the other years depended on her money situation. Konnor's birth was doubly special because Steven called her soon after he was born and asked her to be his godmother. She would not be there in person for the christening, but it was a must to make it out for his first Christmas.\n\nEach time she traveled to the Philippines she brought with her a few traditional decorations, gifts and eatable treats that were distinctly American. Each time she returned she took one distinctly Filipino gift home. When she visited during Christmas of 1963 she brought her own girl child, born the previous year. Of course there was a father, but there was not a husband and Marge decided to raise the child on her own, as a single mother.\n\nThe Christmas of 1989 Marge made a special month long trip and brought an entire suitcase full of goodies special for the holiday and the new baby.\n\n\"It's so good to see you again, Aunt Marge,\" Steven greeted her. Taking her bags and dragging them to the beat up van, he continued, \"It's been a long time. When your own grandchild, Karen, was born, I thought that might be the end of your trips.\"\n\n\"Oh, Steven, some traditions must carry on. My daughter's illness made her decide not to come back. It was very disappointing to me, but she is my daughter. I honored her decision until she got married. I don't know if I'll ever be able to bring my granddaughter, but now that I have a godchild the visits simply must resume.\"\n\n\"Yes, hepatitis is a rampant disease here. I'm sorry it had to touch you, but she and Karen are both good, right?\"\n\n\"Of course they are. I wish Christine would see reason and let me at least bring Karen to see Konnor. I had hoped they might grow up as friends, now I'm not so sure. Neither Christine nor Philip is too interested in a playmate for Karen who's living in a third world country.\"\n\nSteven let the last comment fade away before saying, \"Bettina and Konnor are so looking forward to seeing you. It's a little easier to tell with Bettina, but Konnor's been in a good mood for a week now. I think it's because he knows his godmom is coming to visit.\"\n\nHe loaded the larger of Marge's two suitcases in the back of the van first. \"You are not traveling light this year, Auntie.\"\n\nMarge just smiled as he lifted the second case in, put the carry on packages around them, shut the back and opened the side passenger door for her to get in.\n\nExhausted from the trip, Marge fell asleep sitting beside Steven in the middle seat of the van by the time the driver got them outside the airport limits. She knew this was a good way to manage the frustrating traffic anyway. When they were north of Metro Manila and cruising more smoothly she woke, a tiny bit refreshed, and they started chatting about her granddaughter. \"She's only eighteen months, but she's saying my name already...\n\nYour task is to:\nWhat is the importance of the tradition of visiting the Philippines?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMarge believed that it was important to continue the tradition of visiting the Philippines during Christmas because it was an important part of her culture and she wanted to share that with her family. She also believed that it was important to honor her daughter's decision to not return to the Philippines, until she got married.\u00bb\u00bb",

Fought between the republican and nationalist forces between September and October 1936. The nationalists initially took control of Fernando Poo on 19 September, later seizing control of the rest of the colony after receiving reinforcements in October.\n\nBackground\nThe Spanish Empire established the colony of Spanish Guinea in 1778, in the aftermath of the Treaty of El Pardo, between the former and the Kingdom of Portugal. Portuguese slave traders retained the de facto control of the region until Carlos Chac\u00f3n was declared its first governor general in 1858. During the course of the Scramble for Africa, Spain lost significant portions of its territories in the Gulf of Guinea to France and Germany. Its disastrous defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, further reduced its colonial possessions, while simultaneously increasing Spanish Guinea's importance as an overseas territory. Exploitation of the colony's natural resources began in earnest, missionaries set up permanent outposts across its territory and the Colonial Guard of Spanish Guinea was formed in 1908 to protect its new settlers.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, colonial policies shifted towards increasing Guinea's economic output. To that end, the government limited the influence of Claretian Catholic missionaries and legal rights of the native population. On 13 July 1936, Spanish nationalist legislator Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo was assassinated in Madrid by Guardia de Asalto members, setting a nationalist coup in motion four days later. The outbreak of the civil war in the Spanish mainland, led to confrontations between the supporters of the left wing Popular Front and  (supporters of the nationalist rebels and the Catholic church) across the colony. Tensions continued to escalate during the course of the summer as bank accounts were frozen and shipments failed to reach the colony.\n\nConflict\nOn 19 September 1936, the chief of the Colonial Guard lieutenant colonel Luis Serrano Maranges launched an uprising on Fernando Poo overthrowing the Republican Governor-General Sanchez Guerra in a bloodless coup. Following Francisco Franco's orders, Serrano took over the governorship and imposed martial law, declaring the colony to be at war. Vice-Governor Miguel Hernandez Porcel who was based in Bata, refused to recognize Serrano. On 23 September,  on the colony's mainland organized a militia and marched on Bata in support of Serrano, and Porcel dispatched a force to stop them. The two columns met at Comandachina close to the Ekuku river, they clashed after shouting their respective mottos. Two native soldiers were killed in the action as the Republicans emerged victorious. The leaders of the  in the mainland were expelled to French Congo, many later traveled Fernando Poo. The colony thus became split between the pro-nationalist Fernando Poo and the Republican R\u00edo Muni.\n\nThe republicans became practically isolated from their allies, having turned their only available ship, the Fernando Poo, into a prison for Catholic missionaries and nuns. In October, the nationalist auxiliary cruiser Ciudad de Mahon, armed with a 76 mm gun, a 101 mm gun and ferrying Moroccan nationalist troops from the Canary islands, arrived at Fernando Poo. Serrano requisitioned the ship, using it to shell Bata and hit Fernando Poo, killing three clergymen and a civilian held on board as prisoners in the process. The republican militiamen manning the Fernando Poo abandoned hastily the sinking ship, whose hull was assaulted by troops from Ciudad de Mahon before capsizing the following day. The nationalist reinforcements then landed in Bata, quickly seizing control of R\u00edo Muni. Most republicans fled to French Congo, some of those who remained were executed while others were deported to the Canary Islands in November.\n\nAftermath\nThe conflict in combination with the disruption of global trade during World War II caused the colony to experience shortages in food and medication as well as high inflation. After taking control of the colony the nationalists Hispanicized the names of the local districts, legally unified Fernando Poo and R\u00edo Muni with the rest of Spain and gradually emancipated the native population. The ideals of nationalism spread among the first generation of emancipated natives, who later led the colony to independence.\n\nFootnotes\n\"\"\"\nWhich of the following opinions best describes the author's position on the events described in the text?

Callum Patton's expertly flighted 20-yard free kick cleared the defensive wall and crashed off the underside of the bar on its way into the net.\n\nAs the half progressed, Whitley had chances to go in front and Thibault Charmey's spectacular overhead kick was only kept out by a fine full length save from former Bay keeper Jonny Ball.\n\nRobertson then broke clear but his attempted chip over the keeper flew wide.\n\nA second effort by the returning striker was not far off target, but then seven minutes before the interval, Ryhope regained the lead when Elliott Woods was given a free header in front of goal from a corner.\n\nA 30-yard shot from Chris McDonald just cleared the Ryhope bar, then almost on the half-time whistle the lively Robertson burst through again but was denied by Ball.\n\nFive minutes after the restart, Ryhope were awarded a penalty in somewhat controversial circumstances and Nathan O'Neill put his side two goals in front.\n\nWhitley needed a quick response, but after Aiden Haley's header from Callum Patton's corner was saved, play switched to the other end and Flynn was penalised for a push as he tried to grab the ball and referee Shane Sugden pointed to the spot for the second time, with the same outcome, O'Neill converting to put Ryhope into a seemingly unassailable 4-1 lead.\n\nBay made a triple substitution with Liam Brooks, Kyle Patton and Tom Potter all coming of the bench for the last 25 minutes.\n\nThey needed a lucky break and they got it on 70 minutes when Kyle Patton went to ground in the six-yard box and referee adjudged that he had been fouled and awarded the third penalty of the game.\n\nThe decision was hotly disputed by the Ryhope side but when calm had been restored, Callum Patton confidently despatched the spot kick.\n\nThey pushed forward with renewed energy and Ryhope began to find themselves under increasing pressure. Eight minutes from time, Brooks took the ball to the by-line and cut it back across goal where Kyle Patton tapped it home from three yards.\n\nWhitley poured forward in search of an equaliser. With the game entering stoppage time, Liam Brooks had a shot pushed wide, but the never-say-die attitude of the Bay side reaped its reward following continued pressure when in the final minute of added time Brooks gleefully lashed home the equaliser from close range.\n\nIt was his first goal in Bay colours and was a deserved reward for a battling performance by the young former Alnwick Town striker.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nFrom the text given, extract the number of goals scored by each team and their corresponding names. \nUse the following format: [Team name]: [Number of goals scored]\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab[Whitley Bay]: [4]\n[Ryhope CW]: [8]\u00bb\u00bb",

During the regular monthly meeting on Sept. 26 in Arichat, Richmond Municipal Council accepted a recommendation from its committee of the whole to write a letter advocating the \"advancement of the broadband agenda\" to Cape Breton-Canso MP Mike Kelloway, and have staff \"continue to explore funding opportunities.\" CAO Troy MacCulloch said the first draft of a letter is coming from all municipalities across the province, and noted that the Municipality of the County of Antigonish took the lead on this project.\n\nCouncillors approved other motions from the committee of the whole session to: grant the NSCC Strait Area Campus a 15-month lease on land along Unity Drive in the Point Tupper Industrial Park to conduct a heavy equipment operator program; have staff explore the feasibility of installing a fire hydrant on Langley Lane in Point Tupper; request that a staff member and councillor be assigned a position on the Offshore Wind Task Force and Point Tupper Energy Development Committee; provide $669 to ACTing Collectively for a mail-out to seniors; explore funding opportunities and contact the Louisdale Lions Club concerning their request for washrooms at the group's recreation facilities; write a letter to Kelloway supporting retroactive pay for RCMP officers; approve a grant of $3,750 to Holy Guardian Angels Parish; and approve $500 in sponsorship to the Rural Communities Foundation of Nova Scotia.\n\nTwo new members were added to the Accessibility Advisory Committee. Ashley Levandier, a Registered Nurse who works as the Diabetes Education Centre Coordinator, Infection Control Staff for St. Ann Community and Nursing Care Centre, and with Continuing Care and Palliative Care, was one of the members councillors approved. \"And has a child who has a disability, so (she) has first-hand knowledge of that as well,\" Warden Amanda Mombourquette said. The second person to join the committee was Shelley Dorey, Director of the Small Options Home in Arichat. \"She supports individuals with special needs, on a daily basis, and has worked for the ROC Society for about 10 years in the past as well, and is very passionate about helping people be successful,\" noted the warden. In response to a question from Deputy Warden Melanie Sampson, Mombourquette said there are about 10 members of the committee. \"The goal is that we want 50 per cent, or more, of people on that committee, either with lived experience, or who worked for an organization that cares for people with disabilities,\" she replied. \"If you do know of anyone with lived experience, please, please talk to them about considering participating because it is a really great committee and important work to be done there. I think the more voices we have, of people who are living with disabilities every day, that's important; we want those folks to be in the driver's seat making decisions.\"\n\nTo honour National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, council approved a motion to hold an annual flag raising ceremony on the last business day before Sept. 30.\n###\n\nWrite a list format summary of the council motions in at least 5 bulleted points for local residents.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMunicipality of the County of Antigonish took the lead on the project.\nMunicipalities fighting for better high-speed internet access.\nRequest that a staff member and councillor be assigned a position on the Offshore Wind Task Force and Point Tupper Energy Development Committee.\nProvide $669 to ACTing Collectively for a mail-out to seniors.\nExplore funding opportunities and contact the Louisdale Lions Club concerning their request for washrooms at the group's recreation facilities.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abThe reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\n**Questioner:** And what if the mother herself does not eat meat?\n\n**Dadashri:** Then how can you eat it? How will you be able to digest it if it is not in your blood? You may think that you are able to digest it, but ultimately it is detrimental. Today you may not realize this, so it is best if you do not eat it. If you cannot stop eating it, you should at least have the inner intent that it is wrong to eat it and that it would be best for you to stop.\n\nCows, horses and buffaloes will never eat meat. Even if they were starving and you were to feed them meat, they would not eat it. Such is the nature of some in the animal kingdom. Nowadays, even the children of Jain and Hindu parents who do not meat, have begun to do so. I tell these young people that I do not have a problem with them eating meat as long as they kill the animal themselves. If they wish to eat the chicken, they should kill it themselves. They shiver at the sight of blood and yet they want to eat meat. Eating meat is only for those who can tolerate the sight of blood; it is for people of the warrior caste who have played with blood on the battlefields. Do they become uncomfortable at the sight of blood? What kind of effect does the sight of blood have on people?\n\n**Questioner:** They become uneasy.\n\n**Dadashri:** So then, how can they even consider eating meat? Someone else kills the animal and you eat it. This is meaningless. If one were to hear the agony in the cry of a chicken while it is being slaughtered, one would be overcome with a despondency towards the world for the rest of one's life. I myself have heard that cry and that is when I realized the excruciating pain the poor animal suffers.\n\n# The Importance Of Vegetarian Diet\n\n**Questioner:** Are there any obstacles encountered by meat-eaters and vegetarians in their worship of the Lord? What is your opinion?\n\n**Dadashri:** There is no problem for the meat-eater as long as eating meat is 'in his blood'. For such people eating meat does not create an obstacle in their worship to The Lord. The problem occurs when one who is not born of a meat-eating mother, becomes non-vegetarian. But otherwise neither vegetarianism nor non-vegetarianism presents an obstacle in one's worship to The Lord.\n\n**Questioner:** So is worship possible without a diet of pure vegetarian food?\n\n**Dadashri:** No, it is not possible, but in this day and age, what can one do? Pure vegetarian food is difficult to get nowadays, and besides very few people have not succumbed to the influences of the current time cycle. People nowadays generally fall into the company of others who lead them astray in a non-spiritual direction.\n\n**Questioner:** How does it affect one if one unknowingly eats non-vegetarian food?\n\n**Dadashri:** Everyone is doing so unknowingly anyway, but nevertheless there are repercussions. What if you unknowingly stuck your hand in a fire? Even a child would get burnt, will it not? Everyone is rewarded the same whether they do it knowingly or unknowingly. The only difference is in the way one suffers the consequences. The consequences of actions carried out unknowingly, will be suffered without knowledge. The consequences of those actions done with knowledge will have to be endured in a state of awareness. That is the only difference.\n\n**Questioner:** So is it certain that food does have an effect on the mind?\n\n**Dadashri:** Everything is the effect of food. Food that is eaten turns into brandy (that which produces a deleterious effect on awareness) in the body. These effects are directly linked with spiritual awareness. Heavy or excessive food decreases spiritual and mental awareness.\n\nFrom the text given, extract the effects of meat consumption on mental health and the effects of non-vegetarianism on spiritual and mental awareness.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abExcessive food decreases spiritual and mental awareness. Non-vegetarianism leads to increased cravings and attachment, which in turn leads to disturbances in mental peace and tranquility. This results in a lack of awareness of the Self, as the mind is constantly distracted by thoughts of craving and attachment. Furthermore, the consumption of meat leads to the accumulation of negative karma, which has a detrimental effect on mental health and well-being.\u00bb\u00bb",

Senior Sydney Crafton led the Tigers with 14 points on the game, marking her third double figure scoring game this season. Crafton finished 4-for-5 from the field, and she made 5-of-6 shots from the free throw line.\n\nScoring in the game started right off the bat, with a jumper from Wichita State in the first few seconds of play, but Bri Kulas quickly responded with a basket of her own, marking the beginning of a 6-0 run for the Tigers. A huge block by Sydney Crafton led the teams into the under-16 media timeout, and, despite the team's fast start, Mizzou kept the Shockers from finding the net until the 14-minute mark on the clock.\n\nLeading the scoring for Mizzou in the first half, Liz Smith hit a jumper with 11:24 on the clock, forcing Wichita State to take a timeout and giving Mizzou a 10-9 lead.\n\nWith 10:35 left in the half, WSU's Jazmien Gordon made a layup to give the Shockers a brief lead in the game, but Crafton sunk two free throws to put Mizzou back on top. Morgan Eye then hit a clutch three-pointer helping the Tigers to a 15-11 lead just before the under-8 media timeout.\n\nWith just under two minutes to play in the first half, the Tigers pulled away thanks to a three-pointer from Crafton and a layup from Kulas. Wichita State answered with a layup in the last minute making it 20-15 in Mizzou's favor. Kulas was fouled with 22 seconds left, and sunk both from the charity stripe. The Tigers went into the locker room at the half with a 22-15 lead over Wichita State.\n\nCrafton started off the scoring in the second half for Mizzou, sinking a free throw and following it up with a layup for the Tigers. The score was answered by a Wichita State three-pointer, but MU still led 25-18 at the under-16 timeout.\n\nWith 15:11 left on the clock, Bri Kulas hit a key three-pointer to negate an earlier jump shot from Wichita State, keeping the Tigers ahead 28-20.

Most psychotherapy takes place when a licensed mental health professional and a patient meet one-on-one or with other patients in a group setting.\n\nPsychotherapy can be used as an alternative to or alongside medication and other treatment options. Choosing the right treatment plan should be based on a person's individual needs and medical situation and occur under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n\nEven when medication relieves symptoms, psychotherapy can help a person address specific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking, irrational fears, problems interacting with other people, or difficulty coping with situations at home, school, or work.\n\nTherapists have different professional backgrounds and specialties. This section and the next have information that can help you find out about a therapist\u2019s credentials and find resources for locating therapists.\n\nThe approach a therapist uses depends on the disorder being treated and the training and experience of that therapist. Therapists may combine and adapt elements of different approaches.\n\nOnce you have identified one or more possible therapists, a preliminary conversation can help you understand how treatment will proceed and decide if you feel comfortable with the therapist. Rapport and trust are essential. Discussions in therapy are deeply personal, and it\u2019s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist and have confidence in their expertise.\n\nMany types of professionals offer psychotherapy. Examples include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. Information on providers\u2019 credentials is available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. In addition, you can find resources to help find a therapist on the NIMH's Help for Mental Illnesses webpage.\n\nYour health insurance provider may have a list of mental health professionals participating in your plan. Other resources on the Help for Mental Illnesses webpage can help you look for reduced-cost health services. When talking with a prospective therapist, ask about treatment fees, whether the therapist participates in insurance plans, and whether there is a sliding scale for fees according to income.\n\nYour task is to:\nPull out the different types of mental health professionals mentioned in the article.

Apart from this each has very little of a life. Sean hasn't met his girlfriend for three weeks and is beginning to wonder if she still lives in his apartment. Vincent is a serial womanizer. Lenny, formerly a writer of porn stories, can't pluck up the courage to ask out his attractive workmate Gail. Jody, unknown to the others, has been fired from her job, but still shows up after her \"shift\" every night to talk.\n\nAt the hospital, Sean strikes up a friendship with the girlfriend of a coma patient; she confides in him that at the time of the accident she was about to end the relationship. Later, the two sleep together.\n\nMeanwhile, Vincent picks up an attractive young woman, who turns out to be Sean's girlfriend Madeline. Several days later Vincent's colleague Joe has a fatal heart attack; As he is taken to the hospital, Vincent accompanies him and runs into Sean. In a moment of humanity he confesses to have slept with Madeline; Sean reacts first with disbelief, then with violence. Returning to his flat, he discovers that Madeline has moved out.\n\nSean receives an anonymous phone call and tracing it discovers that it came from a small town where Madeline's friend has an aunt.  Sean, Lenny and Jody decide to drive there to find Madeline. On the way there they spot Vincent on the side of the road; they pick him up, and Sean says they're even after crushing Vincent's favourite possession - a watch that belonged to Errol Flynn.\n\nUnable to find Madeline the group gather in a cafe and Jody confesses that she lost her job. After Vincent and Lenny leave to play crazy golf, Jody runs into Madeline and sets up a meeting between her and Sean; the two of them discuss the issues in their relationship and come to the conclusion that everything is over.\n\nOn the way back the group stops at a motorway service station; Lenny asks Gail out and is turned down, but still sees this as progress.  Madeline and Sean argue over who gets to keep the flat, but later kiss when taking photobooth pictures together.\n\nThe final scene has Gail finally manage to switch the irritating radio station; the radio plays a noticeably more modern and upbeat song.\n\nCast\nLuke de Woolfson ...

In a largely critical Sight &amp; Sound review, Andy Richards highlighted the \"charmlessness\" of the characters and the \"trite\" pre-credits, Trainspotting-esque voice over.  Although the film was set in Glasgow, only the peripheral characters actually spoke with a regional accent. Overall, Richards brands the film \"impoverished in ideas.\" However, in an article for the BBC, Michael Thomson praises the \"regular supply of smart ideas from writer Jack Lothian and director Saul Metzstein\", while acknowledging the \"plot-contrivance and phoniness\" of the final section.\n\nExternal links\n###\nWhat themes does the film explore, and how do these themes relate to the characters and their situations?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe film explores themes of friendship, loneliness, and self-discovery. The characters are all stuck in dead-end jobs and have little of a life outside of work. Their lives are filled with boredom, frustration, and lack of fulfillment. They turn to each other for support and companionship, and through their interactions, they begin to question their lives and the direction they are headed. The film also touches on the idea of missed opportunities and the consequences of making impulsive decisions.\u00bb\u00bb",

Do you ever get an upstate rush? Ive never been crazy about donuts but these are the aristocrats of the donut world and I salute them. And I hope, Benjamin, your mom isnt going to be too mad as she casts her eye down the police blotter and sees your name there, You little shit! and I hope the authorities remember being young when the whole world sometimes seemed somehow like a gargantuan donut that either pulled you to its bosom (O Tracy!) or kicked downsomewhereto the bloodstream. Sweet donut, do I love thee? I havent mentioned Brando K. Goodluck, 18, from Manhattan, charged with seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. O Brando, O Brando what were you thinking? As I put a donut in my mouth Im thinking I wouldnt mind a joint, and, in any case, maybe all these donuts are pretty dangerous and I wonder what would happen if the rules got jumbled up and the girl playing Tracy Turnblad slid down the page and found herself in the police blotter charged with unlawful possession of a donut. Suddenly America feels different and I like it. Police blotters throughout the nation packed with donutheads and half the country on the run as college girls make secret calls and meet their dealers in dusty ghost towns, sweet vapors drifting through the trees.

(WYMT) - The Pike County Trails Authority is continuing its efforts to get the area's ATV trails on the map.\n\nWork began in 2017 when the county reinstituted its trails authority after the Kentucky Mountain Regional Recreation Authority was established. The county has since worked with property owners and potential businesses to expand and form its trails in preparation for a regional connection.\n\nThat effort is still on the table as a new resolution sits before the General Assembly, which would -among other things- allow local governments to authorize and regulate certain state-maintained roadways as ATV-approved.\n\nAccording to Dist. 2 Commissioner and Authority Chair Jason Tackett, that would allow the county to alter the current law that says ATVs are only able to travel two-tenths of a mile on state roadways. He said this change would allow the county to connect its trails for a seamless travel flow.\n\n\"Just trying to hook together,\" said Tackett. \"We've not got everything worked out on this, but we will all sit down. We all are grownups and we all got the right intention for eastern Kentucky.\"\n\nThe uninterrupted trails system, he said, would heighten the experience for ATV riders, serving as a gateway to other communities and a destination for adventure tourism.\n\n\"We have some people that is investing in Eastern Kentucky and Pike County,\" Tackett said.\n\nHe said the trails in the area are already bringing people in, adding that businesses focused on lodging and ATVs are opening around the Mingo-Pike County line, based on the success of the Hatfield-McCoy trails in West Virginia. A trend he hopes to see continue.\n\nTackett said the system would be a win, not only for his home community but for the region as a whole. He said Eastern Kentucky has assets that are not being tapped into.\n\n\"It is a must for Eastern Kentucky for this bill to pass,\" he said. \"It's out of our reach. It's something the senators and the representatives are gonna have to work on in Frankfort.\"\n\nAccording to Tackett, the goal is to continue developing the 1,400 miles of trail inside of the county as they wait to find out the fate of the bill, deciding if they will be able to connect those with out-of-state trails as planned.\n\n\"It's a big opportunity for everyone in the eastern region,\" he said.\n\nThe Pike County Trails Authority meets on Wednesdays in the Pike County Fiscal Courtroom. Those meetings are open to anyone interested in being a part of the project or opening a business in one of the areas along the trail.\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the text, extract the number of people that might be impacted by this.

Friedau Castle may have been built on the site of one of the buildings from this 10th century grant.  Construction on the castle begun under Bishop Volkart von Neuenburg (1237-1251) but was completed under Heinrich IV von Montfort (1251-1272).  Once it was completed it became the administrative center of the Herrschaft and the home of the bishop's landvogt.\n\nBecause the bishop often needed loans and donations, he used the castle as collateral for loans or as a reward for donations.  In 1358 it was given as collateral to Beringers von Landenberg and four years later, in 1362, Bishop Peter Gelyto gave it to Kunigunde von Toggenburg.  The Toggenburgs held the castle until the death of Frederick VII in 1436 and the extinction of the Toggenburg family.  It appears that the castle had already fallen into ruin by 1387 and the bishop was just granting the rights to the lands and taxes associated with the castle.  With those rights, the bishop included a clause that if the castle was rebuilt, the lands would return to him.\n\nThe castle must have been rebuilt sometime after the extinction of the Toggenburgs, because in 1503 there was once again a vogt at Friedau.  In 1550 the chronicler Ulrich Campell recorded that the castle was a tower surrounded by a wall and moat.  In 1649 the bishop sold the castle to the Vier D\u00f6rfer (four villages: Zizers, Igis, Trimmis and Untervaz).  From then on the castle was used as a prison and gradually became known as the Schelmenturm.  In 1880 the tower was heavily damaged in a fire which destroyed much of Zizers.  The heat was so intense that the stones in the wall cracked and two large rents opened up in the tower.\n\nDuring an archeological excavation of the tower in 2016 several finger and foot bones as well as a leg bone were discovered.  Initial speculation was that the bones came from tortured prisoners.  However, Carbon-14 dating found that the bones dated from before the tower was built in the 13th century.\n\nCastle site\nThe castle is located in the center of Zizers.  It is a square tower about  and has walls that are up to  thick.  It was originally four stories tall with a high entrance on the second story east side.  Following the 1880 fire two large cracks have opened up in the walls.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n List of castles in Switzerland\n###\n\nPlease rewrite this description of Friedau Castle to be more personal and evocative.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSituated in the municipality of Zizers in Graub\u00fcnden, Switzerland, Friedau Castle is a fascinating ruin that has a rich history dating back to the 10th century. The castle was originally built under Bishop Volkart von Neuenburg in the 13th century as the administrative center of the Herrschaft and the home of the bishop's landvogt. However, it soon became collateral for loans and donations, and by the 14th century, it had fallen into ruin.\n\nDespite its state of disrepair, Friedau Castle remains an important symbol of the region's history. The castle's walls and towers are a testament to the engineering prowess of medieval architects, and its location in the center of Zizers makes it a prominent landmark in the town. Visitors can still see the remains of the castle's walls and towers, as well as the moat that once surrounded it.\n\nThe castle's past is shrouded in mystery, and it is unclear exactly what happened to it over the centuries. However, one of the most fascinating discoveries made at the castle was the discovery of several finger and foot bones during an archaeological excavation in 2016. Carbon-14 dating found that the bones dated from before the tower was built in the 13th century, leading to speculation that they belonged to prisoners who had been tortured and executed at the castle.\n\nDespite its grim history, Friedau Castle remains an important part of Switzerland's cultural heritage. Visitors can still experience the castle's beauty and grandeur, even in its ruined state, and imagine what life must have been like for those who lived and worked there centuries ago.\u00bb\u00bb",

Aged nine years, Simpson was abducted, raped, and murdered by asphyxiation when Andrew Peter Garforth (born 5 August 1963) drowned her. Garforth pleaded guilty to the crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nAbduction and murder\nOn 19 August 1992, Simpson disembarked from her school bus. Her mother, who usually met her at the bus stop, was busy that day and had arranged for Simpson's older brother to meet her and accompany her home, after his bus reached the bus stop. Unfortunately his bus arrived later than usual and Simpson was not there. Simpson, not seeing her brother at the bus stop, decided to start walk home as it was only a short distance away. Simpson thought that she would meet her brother at home.\n\nPolice immediately suspected that Simpson had been kidnapped rather than running away. Suspicion fell on a man who was seen working on his car near where Simpson had gotten off the bus. Over a hundred people began searching the area for Simpson, including police, firemen, State Emergency Service members, and volunteers.\n\nTwo days later, on 21 August, police found Simpson's body in a dam at a wildlife sanctuary near her home. Her hands and feet were still bound. Later that day, 29 year old Andrew Peter Garforth was arrested and confessed to the murder. With her house in sight, Garforth had grabbed Simpson, thrown her in the boot of his car and driven off to a remote dam. Once there, he bound her with wire, raped her, weighted her schoolbag and threw her into the dam's reservoir, where she drowned. According to police, Garforth had participated in the search for Simpson on the day her body was found.\n\nArrest\nGarforth confessed to the crime after police detained him, showing no remorse for his actions during the confession and court sessions. He pleaded guilty to the murder of Simpson and was sentenced in 1993 to life imprisonment. Justice Peter Newman refused to fix a non-parole period and ordered that Garforth's papers be marked \"never to be released\".\n\nGarforth appealed to the High Court of Australia, but he was refused special leave. It is one of two similar cases which were refused special leave. In discussing the meaning of \"life imprisonment\" when Garforth appealed his sentence the Judges said, \"the community interest in retribution, deterrence, protection of children and the community in such situations may so strongly outweigh any regard for rehabilitation that a life sentence becomes the only option.\"\n\nIn 1995, Garforth lodged several claims for victims' compensation via his lawyers, relating to alleged assaults which occurred in prison. The claims were later withdrawn after public outrage. Garforth's prisoner status was downgraded upon the recommendation of the Serious Offenders Review Council in 2015, giving him access to prison employment and rehabilitation courses. The council's decision was immediately reversed by Minister for Corrections David Elliott.\n\nAftermath\nSimpson's parents, Christine and Peter Simpson, joined forces with Grace and Garry Lynch, the parents of New South Wales 1986 murder victim Anita Cobby, to create the Homicide Victims Support Group. The group provides support to the families of murder victims and lobbies for victims' rights.\n\nFollowing the 1988 state election, the NSW Government introduced legislation in 1989 and 1990 broadly aimed at truth in sentencing. Garforth's case was often cited as a test case for the application of the principle of life sentencing and security classification.\n\nSee also\n\n List of solved missing person cases\n Murder of Janine Balding\n Murder of Lauren Barry &amp; Nichole Collins\n Murder of Virginia Morse\n Murder of Sian Kingi\n\"\"\"\n\nFrom the text, extract information about the life of the murderer, including his name, age, place of birth, and date of arrest.

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nWhat happened in the fusion chamber?\nFusion is a nuclear reaction that combines two atoms to create one or more new atoms with slightly less total mass. The difference in mass is released as energy, as described by Einstein\u2019s famous equation, E = mc2 , where energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since the speed of light is enormous, converting just a tiny amount of mass into energy \u2013 like what happens in fusion \u2013 produces a similarly enormous amount of energy.\n\nResearchers at the U.S. Government\u2019s National Ignition Facility in California have demonstrated, for the first time, what is known as \u201cfusion ignition.\u201d Ignition is when a fusion reaction produces more energy than is being put into the reaction from an outside source and becomes self-sustaining.\n\nThe technique used at the National Ignition Facility involved shooting 192 lasers at a 0.04 inch (1 mm) pellet of fuel made of deuterium and tritium \u2013 two versions of the element hydrogen with extra neutrons \u2013 placed in a gold canister. When the lasers hit the canister, they produce X-rays that heat and compress the fuel pellet to about 20 times the density of lead and to more than 5 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million Celsius) \u2013 about 100 times hotter than the surface of the Sun. If you can maintain these conditions for a long enough time, the fuel will fuse and release energy.\n\nThe fuel and canister get vaporized within a few billionths of a second during the experiment. Researchers then hope their equipment survived the heat and accurately measured the energy released by the fusion reaction.\n\nSo what did they accomplish?\nTo assess the success of a fusion experiment, physicists look at the ratio between the energy released from the process of fusion and the amount of energy within the lasers. This ratio is called gain.\n\nAnything above a gain of 1 means that the fusion process released more energy than the lasers delivered.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 2022, the National Ignition Facility shot a pellet of fuel with 2 million joules of laser energy \u2013 about the amount of power it takes to run a hair dryer for 15 minutes \u2013 all contained within a few billionths of a second. This triggered a fusion reaction that released 3 million joules. That is a gain of about 1.5, smashing the previous record of a gain of 0.7 achieved by the facility in August 2021.\n\nHow big a deal is this result?\nFusion energy has been the \u201choly grail\u201d of energy production for nearly half a century. While a gain of 1.5 is, I believe, a truly historic scientific breakthrough, there is still a long way to go before fusion is a viable energy source.\n\nWhile the laser energy of 2 million joules was less than the fusion yield of 3 million joules, it took the facility nearly 300 million joules to produce the lasers used in this experiment. This result has shown that fusion ignition is possible, but it will take a lot of work to improve the efficiency to the point where fusion can provide a net positive energy return when taking into consideration the entire end-to-end system, not just a single interaction between the lasers and the fuel.\n\nWhat needs to be improved?\nThere are a number of pieces of the fusion puzzle that scientists have been steadily improving for decades to produce this result, and further work can make this process more efficient.\n\nFirst, lasers were only invented in 1960. When the U.S. government completed construction of the National Ignition Facility in 2009, it was the most powerful laser facility in the world, able to deliver 1 million joules of energy to a target. The 2 million joules it produces today is 50 times more energetic than the next most powerful laser on Earth. More powerful lasers and less energy-intensive ways to produce those powerful lasers could greatly improve the overall efficiency of the system.\n\nFusion conditions are very challenging to sustain, and any small imperfection in the capsule or fuel can increase the energy requirement and decrease efficiency. Scientists have made a lot of progress to more efficiently transfer energy from the laser to the canister and the X-ray radiation from the canister to the fuel capsule, but currently only about 10% to 30% of the total laser energy is transferred to the canister and to the fuel.\n\nFinally, while one part of the fuel, deuterium, is naturally abundant in sea water, tritium is much rarer. Fusion itself actually produces tritium, so researchers are hoping to develop ways of harvesting this tritium directly. In the meantime, there are other methods available to produce the needed fuel.\n\nThese and other scientific, technological and engineering hurdles will need to be overcome before fusion will produce electricity for your home. Work will also need to be done to bring the cost of a fusion power plant well down from the US$3.5 billion of the National Ignition Facility. These steps will require significant investment from both the federal government and private industry.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is a global race around fusion, with many other labs around the world pursuing different techniques. But with the new result from the National Ignition Facility, the world has, for the first time, seen evidence that the dream of fusion is achievable.\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the passage about the fusion ignition, how many lasers were shot? What type of lasers were fired and the sizing of them?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThere were 192 lasers that were shot. These lasers were a type of laser that is called neodymium glass. The lasers had a size of 150-trillionths of a meter.\u00bb\u00bb",

A Graduate Program in Molecular Biology was established at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in 1986 to promote in a multi-disciplinary approach the ability for scientific thinking and working. This Graduate Program presents molecular biology and neuroscience within a broader context of the basic sciences and biomedicine. Fundamental (basic) and clinical (applied) aspects are explored and are integrated with relevant areas of other disciplines. This course, which is organized by the ZMNH, is of particular value to those who plan an academic career in biomedical research or in a related industry.\n\nMajor discoveries\nSeveral proteins that are key to synaptic function were first cloned and characterized at the ZMNH, for example the presynaptic proteins Piccolo (PCLO) and Bassoon and the major organizer of the postsynaptic density, PSD-95 (a.k.a. SAP90). \nSynaptic activity controls the activity of certain genes, the so-called immediate early genes. Arg3.1\/Arc, a prominent example of this gene family, was discovered at the ZMNH and found to have important functions in learning and memory.\n\nAn early focus of the center was understanding the structure and function of ion channels. The famous 'ball-and-chain' mechanism of potassium channel inactivation was discovered at the ZMNH. A number of human diseases (hereditary forms of myotonia, osteopetrosis, retinal degeneration, kidney stone diseases, epilepsy, deafness) could be mapped to mutations in specific ion channels. These fundamental insights allowed researchers to mimic important aspects of human diseases in genetically accurate animal models, a key step in the development of new drugs.\n\nMore recently, ZMNH researchers developed novel genetic tools to control neuronal activity with light (optogenetics), including the first light-gated chloride channel ChloC and the light-activated potassium channel PACK.\n\nExternal links\n Homepage of the ZMNH\n Blankenese conferences, organized by the ZMNH\n Teaching at the ZMNH\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the text given, extract information on the first light-gated chloride channel, ChloC.

The queen pleads for her life until her child is born.  \n\nFause Foodrage tells her that if the baby is a boy, he will die.  He sets guards on her, but she gets them drunk and leaves out a window.  She has a son in a pigsty.  Wise William is sent to seek her; he sends his wife, and when she finds her, she persuades her to change her son for her daughter, saying that they will both raise the other's child fittingly. \nWhen the boy is grown, Wise William takes him by the royal castle and tells him the truth. \nThe son kills Fause Foodrage, rewards Wise William, and marries the daughter that his mother raised.\n\nWalter Scott commented that King Easter and King Wester represent \"petty princes of Northumberland and Westmoreland\" but later retracted this opinion.\n\nVariants\nChild ballad 90 Jellon Grame has affinities to this ballad.\n\nThis ballad is closely related with a Scandinavian one, \"Young William\" (TSB E\u00a096), in which a rival in love kills the successful wooer, the woman bears a child and has the rival told it was a girl, and the son, grown, kills the rival.  Another Scandinavian ballad (TSB D\u00a0352) opens with the bride being carried off, and her family coming to burn down the church that the bridegroom and his people are in; she hides her son from her family and in time he avenges his father.\n\nModern interpretations\nThe tune recorded with Fause Foodrage was used for the ballad Willie o Winsbury by mistake by \nAndy Irvine of  Sweeney's Men (1968) and has since frequently been used for that song. \nAn arrangement of this tune is used in The Wicker Man (1973) for the \"procession\" scene.\n\nIn contrast to Willie o Winsbury, the ballad Fause Foodrage has only rarely been recorded by modern folk musicians. One recording is that by Hermes Nye (1957).\n\nYour task is to:\nWhat was the cultural and historical context of the murder ballad \"Fause Foodrage\"?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab\"Fause Foodrage\" is a Scottish murder ballad that dates back to the 17th or 18th century. It was first printed by Walter Scott in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802). The ballad is believed to have been written by Elizabeth, Lady Wardlaw.\n\nThe ballad is set in a time of political unrest, with a rebellion of nobles and a king being killed. The protagonist, \"False Foodrage,\" is either forced to kill the king or does so out of revenge for being rejected by the king's queen. The ballad has several variants, but the most common version involves the queen being spared and having a son. The son grows up and seeks revenge by killing \"False Foodrage.\"\n\nThe ballad reflects the social and political tensions of the time, with power struggles and violence between nobles and the monarchy. The theme of revenge and the use of a mother's love to protect her child also add to the emotional impact of the ballad.\u00bb\u00bb",

The early theories mainly provided information about the evolution process of the earth and planets with other heavenly bodies. The modern theory of the origin of the earth is mainly associated with the big bang theory. According to modern theory, all matters of the universe or the matters forming the universe were condensed in a tiny small point. The small point consists of a small volume but it has infinite temperature and infinite density. The most widely accepted modern theory regarding the origin of the earth is the \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d.  It shows how the universe grows from an atom-sized point by which the whole universe lies. The most accepted hypothesis of \u201cplanetary formation\u201d is the \u201cnebular Hypothesis\u201d and the hypothesis considers the gravitational collapse of a huge molecular cloud.\n\nThe Disk Instability Theory\nThe \u201cDisk Stability Theory\u201d explains the process in which a massive sized disk cools down rapidly and causes the production of fragments that are self-gravitating clumps. This theory is less popular but it is still a plausible explanation. According to the theory, in the very early stages of the formation of the proto\u2013planetary disk, a rapid cooling occurred in the order of orbital timescale. The fragments then started to condense and formed the different heavenly bodies and planets. This theory provided a brief explanation of the \u2018planet formation\u2019 that may occur in a too-short frame of time. This theory can also be utilised to describe the presence of large planets made of gases that are close or maybe very far from the star. A disk could quickly cool down enough to \u2018fragment\u2019 on an \u2018orbital scale\u2019. This could be only possible when there is a very large \u201corbital radius\u201d.\n\nBig Bang Theory regarding Earth\u2019s Origin\nThe \u201cbig bang theory\u201d is the most famous theory regarding the origin of the earth. In 1931, Belgian cosmologists came up with the big bang theory. The theory says that all the matter that made the universe remained at a single point or location. The volume of that point was considered as smaller as an atom but that atom-sized point is considered to have infinite density and unlimited temperature. According to the theory, the point was initially condensed into a single particle then it began to expand again with a huge explosion. The explosion gave birth to the nebula and the nebula turned into stars and planets. The community of scientists unanimously believes that the age of the universe is around 13.7 billion years. \n\nNebular Hypothesis of Earth\u2019s Origin  \nThe nebular hypothesis is the theory that refers to the spinning clouds of dust that are made of light elements. The springing cloud is considered a Nebula and the Nebula becomes a solar system and contains stars and planets revolving around the stars. As per the construction of the solar system, the nebular clouds of scattered particles are developed in different temperature zones. The temperature was very high close to the centre or close to the stars which allowed the condensation of the metal and silicate to a high temperature. Having more distance from the sun the temperature being low allows the condensation of the gases, which are lighter. The difference in temperature resulted in the inner planets becoming rocky and the outer planets becoming the gaseous planets. \n\nConclusion\nThe above topic deals with the modern theories of the origin of the earth. In this topic, the concepts of the different modern theories regarding the earth\u2019s origin have been discussed in detail. The   \u201cDisk Instability Theory\u201d has also been elaborated to understand the formation of planets. The \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d has also been analyzed in this context. The \u201cNebular Hypothesis of earth\u2019s\u201d origin has also been analyzed. At last, a few FAQs have been discussed for a better understanding of the topic.\n###\nFrom the passage extract and list the various theories of the origin of the earth.
