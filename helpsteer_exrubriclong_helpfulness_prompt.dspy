The remaining two passengers \u2014 ages 17 and 15 \u2014 were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, but they were both pronounced dead a short time later.\n\nA preliminary investigation carried out by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol revealed the Chevy stopped behind another vehicle at the traffic sign but did not come to a full stop before it entered the intersection. The National Transportation and Safety Board on Thursday, citing witness accounts, confirmed the vehicle came to a \"rolling stop\" before the deadly collision.\n\nIn this image provided by KFOR-TV, a heavily damaged vehicle is seen off a road in Tishomingo, Okla., following a two-vehicle collision in which six teenage students were killed, Tuesday, March 22, 2022. (AP)\n\nThe southbound semitrailer then struck the front left side of the hatchback, carrying the girls eastbound, the impact of which sent both vehicles flying off the roadway, according to the NTSB.\n\n\"Our prayers are with each of the families involved and our community,\" the Johnston County Oklahoma Sheriff's Office said on Facebook in wake of the tragedy. \"This is an absolute tragedy which will have life long effects. This community and families need our support and prayers at this time.\n\nThe Highway Patrol identified the driver of the truck as 51-yaer-old Valendon Burton of Burneyville, Okla. He was not injured in the incident.\n\nBoth the NTSB and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol's Traffic Homicide Unit continue to investigate.\n\"\"\"\n\nRewrite the text to be more emotional and less factual, as though it were written by a grieving teacher.\n\nYesterday, my students and I were out for lunch when we witnessed a horrible collision. Our car was stopped at a stop sign when a massive truck ran into us at full speed. My students and I were all thrown against the dashboard and windows, and I was the only one to survive.\n\nThe truck driver did not see us at the stop sign and did not even attempt to slow down or change course. The impact was so great that it sent our car flying off the road and into a ditch. My students were all killed instantly, and I am devastated.\n\nI am grieving for my students, who were all so young and had so much potential. They were all members of our school choir and had such beautiful voices. They were my friends and my family, and I will miss them terribly.\n\nThis tragedy has affected our whole community, and we are all grieving together. We are praying for the families of my students and for the truck driver, who is also suffering.\n\nI am grateful to be alive, but I feel so lost without my students.

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nConversely, there is a lack of qualitative studies exploring the risk and protection factors. For this reason, in this study we decided to use a qualitative approach to explore \u201cmore up close\u201d this kind of organizational context and to keep together the different levels in systemic terms in order to identify \u2013 according to professionals\u2019 perceptions \u2013 resource factors (in order to leverage these aspects) and fatigue factors (to identify them and treat them). Three Italian Care Homes were involved and the interview\u2019s sample was composed of 45 professionals \u2013 15 nurses, 30 total Patient Care Assistants (PCAs) and Auxiliary Care Assistants (ACAs), of these, 17 males and 28 females, with an average age of 43 years (SD = 0.78) \u2013 selected using a sampling of maximum variability. From the analysis of the materials there seem to be four profiles of the professionals involved. Implications to ensure a functional human resource management are discussed for the purpose of promote the well-being of the various professionals, and, as a result, an increasing quality of service.\n\nThe present study aims to offer a contribution to the understanding of the care professions that work in Care Homes [in Italy, Residenze Sanitarie Assistenziali (RSA)] because due to the complex challenges they face they are likely to experience various forms of physical and emotional malaise.\n\nFirst evidence related to the attention for care professions concerns the incremental aging of the Italian population: 200,000 non-self-sufficient seniors are guests in residential structures, 2.5 million live with their families, but 4.7 million seniors would opt to live in residences if their quality of life improved. Furthermore, the increased age of the guests welcomed in Care Homes determines a physical and mental health situation characterized by co-occurrence of illnesses, psychological and behavioral instability, fragility, and therefore the work required of operators is focused on the preservation of the remaining capacity, the management of chronic illness and assistance in activities of daily living. Another element to consider is the process of corporatization that increasingly impacts Italian care settings, implying that professionals are supposed to be able to optimize time, resources, and costs. At the same time, there is a demand by family members and guests for a higher quality of services and a consequent increase in the degree of competitiveness, pressure within this sector and demands in terms of emotional and physical investment.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a growing interest in the study and understanding of professions in geriatric care settings. In the literature there is a prevalence of cohort, cross-sectional and comparative studies that offer an overview in terms of indicators \u2013 at the individual or group or organizational level \u2013 concerning the potential development of situations of professional malaise. Studies that examined the individual dimension have shown that a lack of sense of control and mastery over one\u2019s working conditions and fear of making mistakes represent risk factors for operators. It is also true that the ability to exercise decision-making autonomy with respect to the assumption of one\u2019s role can represent not only an important protection factor, but also a stimulus in terms of performance and skills development. Studies on elements related to the group show that poor levels of coordination and integration between teams and roles, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships are factors that affect the well-being of the people who make up the working team. This is in line with the assumption that social support from colleagues acts as a \u201cbuffer\u201d against the negative effects of the work on one\u2019s health and well-being. Additionally, the professionals who work in Care Homes very often have to negotiate with the role expectations of guests and their families, as well as with those of colleagues and the organization. In fact, the transition to a care home for a family is much more than a change in location, and often family members pour out all their anxieties and fears related to this stage of the family cycle on operators. More infrequent are the studies on elements related to the organizational level. They showed the influence that culture and climate have on operator comfort. More precisely, some studies have shown that elements like a low degree of individual responsibility attributed to the individual operator, a lack of open and clear communication, a rigid leadership, the lack of spaces and channels for discussion are more likely to be associated with episodes of stress, job dissatisfaction, and poor quality of work. Similarly, a correlation has been demonstrated between organizational cultures and climates oriented toward encouraging and promoting the processes of empowerment, communication and participation and the influence these have on the quality of life in Care Homes both for operators and for guests. To this must be added the uncertainty and insecurity related to the continuous changes that affect the healthcare world, and the quantity and quality of information made available to professionals may contribute positively or negatively to well-being. In summary, analyzing the literature we can see that most works are quantitative research focused mostly on just one analysis level. Conversely, there are fewer qualitative studies that extensively explore the risk and protection factors. For these reasons, this study therefore aims to \u201cgive a voice\u201d to the operators exploring efforts and resources that they perceive and represent to be a priority for their profession in order to further the knowledge of this phenomenon and identify lines of action in support of the professionals and organizational effectiveness. In light of our experience researching and working with organizations, it was decided to approach the complexity of these contexts by adopting a psycho-sociological approach to the study of professional roles. This means simultaneously keeping in mind and considering three different levels:\n\n(1) The individual level (the stories and the personal and professional experiences of the participants).\n\n(2) The group level (the operation of the work group, relationships with colleagues).\n\n(3) The organizational level (the operation of the organization as a whole and its organizational culture).\n\nInstruction:\nClassify the given sentences from the article as facts or opinions.

Instead of jumping down the ladder to start flying, he reached the ceiling and tried to open up the hole.\n\nJohn was not very tall and also a little overweight and clumsy, and he could not reach the ceiling very well even from the last step. But all of a sudden the ceiling gave in, producing a little crack. John pushed a little harder, and the crack grew, but John was not tall enough to open the ceiling all the way. He jumped and pushed at the same time but ended up in bed. \"Was I sleeping?\" he wondered to himself. \"Had to be,\" he concluded. But the idea in his dream was not a bad one, so he started climbing the ladder to try to implement it in real life. He got all the way up, pushed on the ceiling, and again nothing was happening for a while. Then finally a small crack showed up. John jumped and found himself lying in his bed. \"What's going on?\" he wondered.\n\nHe looked around to see if there were any objects, with which he could prop the ceiling up or push on it so the crack opened further, but the room as always was empty, except for his bed. John scrutinized his bed and discovered that the legs would easily come off. He unscrewed a couple of them, so now his bed was standing on an angle with the head part up, and started climbing the ladder with a bed leg in each of his hands. He used one of them to prop the ceiling open a little bit so it would not slam shut right away, and then he used the other leg to keep pushing it up. Unfortunately, he did not take into account the fact that when the hole opened more, the first leg would fall back out, which it did and hit John painfully on the head. Then it dropped all the way down.\n\n\"Ouch!\" John muttered and started going down the ladder to get it back, when the hole in the ceiling fully opened and the Adventurous peeked in.\n\n\"I see you are well rested and ready for action,\" he noted. \"How about a flying lesson?\"\n\n\"That's what I was about to do,\" said John, quickly making up a lie. \"I was going to try jumping off the floor of the room above mine instead of the ladder, so I had more room to fly.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the Adventurous in disbelief. \"How about a real flying lesson? There are not many of them left, after which you can work at your own convenience on mastering the maneuvers, then the test, and then you get full freedom of moving around.\"\n\n\"Sounds very promising,\" John said sarcastically. \"The only thing I don't understand is why we have to learn to fly BEFORE getting freedom to move around? What difference does it make? Is there any harm in me getting out and wondering back and forth in the corridor we were stuck in before, without being able to fly?\"\n\n\"Well, that's the point. You could not get anywhere beyond that corridor. If you call getting into that corridor and being stuck in it 'freedom', I feel bad for you.\"\n\n\"Ok, I'll accept this explanation for now. I admit that being stuck in the corridor isn't freedom; I was just hoping that next time around I won't get stuck... Anyway, what do you have to show me today?\"\n\nJohn decided to play along. Deep in his heart he was hoping that Megan was mistaken about flying being a trap. That had to be verified before at least he, personally, made his final decision to not fly. But in order to do that, he had to somehow be able to get out of this room.\n<end of reference>\nExtract from the text the words or phrases that are used to explain why the human needs to learn to fly before being allowed to move around on his own.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abIt is the point\u00bb\u00bb",

In 2021, that number jumped to more than 1,260.\n\nDoctors say Indiana is in the bottom 20% of states when it comes to access to child psychiatrists and in the top half of states when it comes to youth suicide rates. The Colts want to help change those stats.\n\n\"One very important cause we want to get behind is mental health awareness,\" Colts owner Jim Irsay said when launching the \"Kick the Stigma\" campaign.\n\nThe Irsay family's initiative hopes to raise awareness about mental health disorders and to remove the shame and stigma often associated with these illnesses. The Colts say this gift is part of that campaign and they hope to improve access to mental health services for kids in Indiana.\n\nIrsay tweeted about Tuesday's announcement, echoing that the need is great. He said \"Tomorrow we will announce a gift to @RileyKids to improve access to mental health services for Indiana's kids. Physicians\/staff at Riley Hospital say the need is great (e.g., each week, as many as 500 families call Riley seeking outpatient mental health care for a child!).\"\n\nTomorrow we will announce a gift to @RileyKids to improve access to mental health services for Indiana's kids. Physicians\/staff at Riley Hospital say the need is great (e.g., each week, as many as 500 families call Riley seeking outpatient mental health care for a child!).\n<end of reference>\nWhat is the specific gift from the Indianapolis Colts to the Riley Children's Foundation and how will it improve mental health services for Indiana's children?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe Indianapolis Colts have donated $2.5 million to the Riley Children's Foundation to help expand mental health services for Indiana's children and adolescents. This gift will help improve access to mental health services and is part of the \"Kick the Stigma\" campaign launched by Colts owner Jim Irsay to raise awareness about mental health disorders and remove the shame and stigma associated with these illnesses.\u00bb\u00bb",

NPPU values determined for milk, soya protein isolate and wheat were 81%, 78% and 66%, respectively (Bos _et al_., 1999; Tome and Bos, 2000; Mariotti _et al_., 1999; Bos _et al_., 2005). This approach also incorporates the determination of true ileal amino acid digestibility (Gaudichon _et al_., 2002).\n\nThis method is a major advance in the evaluation of dietary protein quality. It is restricted, however, to foods that can be intrinsically labelled with 15N and the study requires that ileal digesta be collected via a naso-intestinal intubation technique, and the model calculations are fairly complex (Juillet _et al_., 2006). Therefore, this method is unlikely to be widely adopted for routine application. Furthermore the NPPU technique cannot be readily used to estimate the bioavailability of individual amino acids.\n\n## Application of the IAAO method to determine the metabolic availability (MA) of amino acids\n\nThe Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation (IAAO) technique is based on the concept that when one dietary indispensable amino acid in a diet (IDAA) is deficient for protein synthesis, then all other amino acids including the indicator amino acid (another IDAA, usually L-[1-13C]phenylalanine) will be oxidized (Pencharz and Ball, 2003). Fundamentally, this is because free amino acids cannot be stored and therefore must be partitioned between incorporation into protein or oxidation. With increasing intake of the limiting amino acid, oxidation of the indicator amino acid decreases, reflecting increasing incorporation into protein. Once the requirement for the limiting amino acid is met, there is no further change in the oxidation of the indicator amino acid. The inflection point, where the oxidation of the indicator amino acid stops decreasing and reaches a plateau is referred to as the 'breakpoint'. The breakpoint identified with the use of bi-phase linear regression analysis indicates the mean or Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of the limiting (test) amino acid (Pencharz and Ball, 2003). This minimally invasive IAAO method has been systematically applied to determine IDAA requirements in adult humans (Pencharz and Ball, 2003; Elango _et al_., 2008(a); Elango _et al_., 2008(b)).\n\nThe IAAO method can also be applied to determine the bioavailability or metabolic availability (MA) of amino acids (Moehn _et al_., 2005; Moehn _et al_., 2007). IAAO is inversely proportional to the rate of protein synthesis (Ball and Bayley, 1986; Rafii _et al_., 2008). Therefore, at a given amino acid intake, the relative difference in the IAAO rate between test and reference proteins will be proportional to the whole body MA of the test amino acid for protein synthesis, and thus account for all losses of dietary amino acids during digestion, absorption, and cellular metabolism. It would be expected, under controlled conditions and for the often dietary first-limiting amino acid, lysine, that the predicted uptake of reactive lysine (true ileal digestible reactive lysine) from the digestive tract would equal bioavailable lysine determined using the IAAO method and such an experimental comparison for a range of foods would be of interest. The IAAO approach has been used in pigs to determine the availability of dietary protein-bound amino acids (including lysine, threonine and methionine) and in humans for methionine and lysine. It is proving to be a practical method to determine the utilization of protein bound limiting amino acids for net protein synthesis.\n\n## 4.6AMINO ACID ANALYSIS AND TRUE AMINO ACID DIGESTIBILITY\/BIOAVAILABILITY METHODOLOGIES\n\n## Amino acid analysis methodology\n\nConsiderable progress has been made over recent years in amino acid analysis (Rutherfurd and Sarwar-Gilani, 2009; Otter, 2012) and the Committee agreed that no one method of analysis is necessarily the best, with a variety of approaches being acceptable.\n\nAmino acids occur in foods in either the free amino acid form or as the building blocks of proteins. The analysis of amino acids in foods is composed of a number of unit operations; the release of the amino acids (if they are in protein form) from the food matrix, the separation of the individual amino acids and their quantification using calibration standards.\n\nEach of these steps has its own idiosyncrasies, (e.g.\n\"\"\"\nWrite a summary of the unit operations required to analyze amino acids in a food matrix in at least 5 bulleted points for students.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abNo\u00bb\u00bb",

Again, the image of the brow Chakra is repeated as the difficult throat Chakra is revealed. See how preparatory images of the heart Chakra appear as echoes of other disclosures.\n\nThe order of disclosure is meaningful. First the Kundalini, the energies of the Chakras, then the first Chakra, then the guardian brow Chakra. Next the Chakra of wrath is revealed before the obscure throat Chakra, then the hidden sacral plexus Chakra, whose hexagram structure is echoed in aspects of the throat Chakra itself. Then comes the heart Chakra after much preparation, then finally the crown Chakra, the Cosmos itself.\n\nI did not notice the second feature until twenty months after the meditations! Learning from experience is surely a lengthy process.\n\nIn the last meditation the top three Chakras are linked in a composite structure. Now, look at my version of the base Chakra, the chalice-like bowl and host above it. Can you see the throat Chakra in the base and armature? See the brow Chakra stripped of its petals\/wings in the globe and see the remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.\n\nI believe there is a great mystery in this coincidence of forms.\n\nNow notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme. Notice also how unique each of these forms is. Both are very active Chakras \u2013 both are _living_ Chakras. I believe that we, as human beings, have made these Chakras. I believe it is these Chakras that are to be transformed into the higher natures. See that the heart Chakra, the Chakra of the transforming Ego, has already begun this process in the throat Chakra.\n\n9\/9\/99\n\nThe Spiritual Organs\n\nTHE SPIRITUAL BODY\n\nInitiation is nothing other than man's gaining the capacity of developing organs of vision in his higher bodies.\n\nRudolf Steiner, _Egyptian Myths and Mysteries_.\n\nI want here to extend the scheme laid out in my last essay on the Spiritual Organs. You will find that the means used to gain this new knowledge differs significantly from that used in my previous essay. There, if you remember, disclosure was by and large involuntary and complete in every instance \u2013 I mean that the images revealed were complete in themselves, even though they might be extended or augmented at a later stage by other images. Here, as you will see, knowledge is gained in a more piecemeal way, often by simply studying familiar schemes in a new light. And while an overall pattern will emerge, many details will remain hidden, awaiting future investigation.\n\nThese very different spiritual experiences arise because they are received by different parts of our being. Characterising these experiences as image-concept and form-presence, we can pinpoint the sources of the experiences in the astral-mental and the etheric-will respectively.\n\nFrom the text given, extract information about the connection between the spiritual organs and the seven Chakras. \nUse the following format: [Chakra]: [Information about the connection]i\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab[Brow]: [See how preparatory images of the heart Chakra appear as echoes of other disclosures.]\n[Throat]: [The remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.]\n[Heart]: [The heart Chakra, the Chakra of the transforming Ego, has already begun this process in the throat Chakra.]\n[Sacral Plexus]: [Notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme.]\n[Solar Plexus]: [Notice that the sacral plexus and solar plexus Chakras are excluded from this scheme.]\n[Crown]: [The remote crown Chakra in the white spot at the tip of the globe.]\u00bb\u00bb",

Although there are extensive liner notes from Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson for each track in the booklet of the CD, sometimes it isn't easy to classify the tracks chronologically. \"Walking\" is - considering the chronology - the first recorded track on this compilation. It was recorded by Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson in 1972, so it might be a recording of the band Blue Condition. The tracks, which are following chronologically, are those from the Tapestry Sessions in early 1976, shortly after the band changed its name from S.O.B. to Son Of A Bitch. These songs are \"Still Fit to Rock 'n' Roll\", the early title of \"Still Fit to Boogie\", \"Ain't You Glad to Be Alive\" and the first version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 1)\" in the booklet and misprinted as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" on the inlay). Then there are the tracks from the Luxemburg sessions in 1978, still recorded under the moniker of Son Of A Bitch. These tracks are \"See the Light Shining\", \"Stand up and Be Counted\", the second version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" in the booklet and on the inlay), \"Ann Marie\", \"Lift up Your Eyes\" and \"Street Fighting Gang\" (misprinted as \"Street Fighting Man\" in the booklet and on the inlay). Some tracks on the CD are from the period when the band had already changed its name to Saxon. Those are the three live tracks \"Stallions of the Highway\", \"Midnight Rider\" and \"Frozen Rainbow\" with Nigel Glockler on drums, the \"Stone Room Jam\", which was recorded during the mixing of the live album The Eagle Has Landed in 1982 and the Power and the Glory-outtakes \"Turn out the Lights\", \"Coming to the Rescue\" and \"Make 'em Rock\". The studio version of \"Frozen Rainbow\" with Rod Argent on keyboards and the original version of \"Big teaser\" cannot be classified chronologically, but they seem to be recorded, when Saxon still was called Son Of A Bitch.

Vertigo is a type of dizziness that is caused by an imbalance in the inner ear. It can be a very bothersome condition, but fortunately there are treatments that can help lessen the symptoms.\nKhiry: Oh, thank goodness! What kind of treatments are available?\nDoctor: There are several options available. One option is vestibular rehabilitation therapy, which is a type of physical therapy specifically designed to help patients with vertigo. This therapy can help improve balance and reduce dizziness by exercises that retrain the brain to process information from the inner ear more effectively. Another option is medication, which can help relieve symptoms by reducing inflammation in the inner ear or by affecting nerve signals that contribute to dizziness. Finally, some patients find relief with surgery, although this is usually only recommended for severe cases that have not responded to other treatments.\nKhiry: Wow, there are quite a few options available! I think I would like to try vestibular rehabilitation therapy first. Can you tell me more about it?\nDoctor: Sure! Vestibular rehabilitation therapy typically consists of a series of exercises specifically designed to retrain the brain to process information from the inner ear more effectively. These exercises often involve moving your head in specific ways while watching an object so that your brain can learn how to properly interpret information from your inner ear and maintain balance even when movement occurs. The therapist will also likely teach you some exercises that you can do at home to continue practicing between sessions. Generally speaking, most people see improvement within 10-12 sessions; however, everyone responds differently so some people may need more or fewer sessions depending on their individual case.\nKhiry: That sounds like it could really help me!

Was it she who left her lips on the block for the executioner, Whose hands would never find ablution, who would never touch a woman Again or eat the flesh of a red animal?

The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, Ukraine led to the release of 400 times more radiation than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during WW2. 31 people died in the immediate aftermath, whilst the long-term health effects caused by Chornobyl are still a hotly debated subject. Approximately 60,000 square miles around the plant were contaminated and an area nearly twice the city of London remains an exclusion zone to this day. Lying just 10 miles from the Belarus-Ukraine border and around 62 miles north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned in 1977 as part of the old Soviet Union, with the first reactor supplying power to the grid later that year. By 1984, four reactors had entered commercial operation, each capable of producing 1,000 megawatts of electrical power. Just under two miles from the plant was the city of Pripyat, founded in 1970 and named after the nearby river. It was built to serve the power plant and at the time of the disaster, its total population was just shy of 50,000.\nThroughout Friday, 25th April 1986, Chornobyl's engineers lowered power at Reactor No. 4 in preparation for a safety test to be conducted later that evening. The test was supposed to check whether the reactor turbines could continue powering emergency water coolant pumps in the event of a power failure. Ironically, the safety test was anything but safe as human error and substandard reactor design led to a partial meltdown of the core. The experiment was poorly conceived and equally badly executed. Firstly, the less-experienced night shift crew carried out the safety test and later claimed they had not received full instructions from the day shift crew on how to properly conduct it. Secondly, the emergency core cooling system for Reactor 4 was disabled along with the emergency shutdown system.\nFinally, the reactor\u2019s power level dropped to a dangerously unstable level at which point the engineers removed most of the control rods in violation of safety guidelines. Although power began to return, it was far from under control. At 1:23 am on 26th April, the safety test was given the all-clear by plant supervisors. Almost immediately a power surge occurred, triggering the engineers to re-insert all 211 control rods. The control rods were graphite tipped, a design flaw that would prove fatal as they increased the reaction in the core, instead of lowering it. The subsequent steam explosions blew off the steel and concrete lid of the reactor as the core suffered a partial meltdown. Two engineers were killed instantly whilst two more suffered severe burns. The explosion, along with the resulting fires, released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere. Blown by the wind, radioactive materials were spread to many parts of Europe over the coming days.\n\"\"\"\n\nPlease draw out the content directly from this article and compose a 100 word summary of why the reactor at Chernobyl went into meltdown. Please include this extraction in the form of a short article. Please use a positive and formal tone throughout the article.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAs the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, Chernobyl has become a cautionary tale of the potential dangers of nuclear power. On April 26, 1986, a flawed reactor design and a series of operator errors led to a catastrophic nuclear meltdown at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. The resulting explosion and fire released large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere, contaminating nearby areas and causing widespread health effects. The incident led to the evacuation of thousands of people from the surrounding region and brought the dangers of nuclear energy to the forefront of public consciousness. Today, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone remains largely off-limits to humans, serving as a reminder of the devastating impact of nuclear accidents and the importance of safety in the operation of nuclear power plants.\u00bb\u00bb",

Proponents of in vitro meat production highlight its potential to reduce animal suffering, decrease land and water use, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing a sustainable and healthy source of protein. Additionally, in vitro meat could offer a more controlled and safer environment for producing meat, as it can be monitored and tested for contamination and pathogens.\n\nOn the other hand, some concerns have been raised about the potential health risks associated with in vitro meat, such as the possibility of contamination or the use of growth hormones and antibiotics. Additionally, the cost of producing in vitro meat is currently high, which could limit its accessibility to consumers. There are also ethical concerns about the use of animal cells for the production of meat, and some argue that in vitro meat is not a sustainable solution to the problems of animal agriculture.\n\nOverall, while in vitro meat production has the potential to offer a more sustainable and ethical source of protein, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before it can become a mainstream alternative to traditional meat production. Further research and development is needed to address the concerns raised by critics and make in vitro meat a viable and affordable option for consumers.\u00bb\u00bb",

It was the darkness itself that wanted to swallow her as well, and she knew this.\n\nIt felt like eons had passed before she found Daniel. As she approached him she could tell that he was still beaten up pretty badly but looked a lot better. Abby threw herself on him and covered him with kisses. Daniel stopped but did not return her kisses. He stood staring straight ahead and waited for her to finish.\n\n\"Daniel, I've missed you.\" Abby said.\n\nDaniel did not answer. Abby seeing that he wasn't responding to her, she stepped back. Daniel turned his head, made eye contact with her.\n\n\"Have faith.\" He said.\n\nThe great horn bellowed again, but this time it was much louder. The percussion of the horn sent Abby to her knees. Covering her ears she started to scream, but her cries went unheard. The sounds of her screams were lost inside the defining bellow of the horn.\n\n#\n\nAbby awoke in a cold sweat. Tears began to fill her eyes as she thought of Daniel and the words he spoke in the dream. Quickly, Abby removed herself from her bed and found the book with the unopened envelope inside. The two words she wrote on the outside of the envelope were the same two words Daniel spoke in the new dream.\n\n\"That's twice now.\" She spoke aloud. Wanting to tear open the envelope and read the words inside, she forced herself not to. It took everything she had not to open it. Instead, Abby wrote the number two next to the two words she had written on the envelope and slid it back into the book.\n\n#\n\nFive years passed without another dream. In that time Desolation slipped from Abby's mind, as did the envelope. Daniel on the other hand remained. She also fell in love with a man named James.\n\nHe was a good man and treated Abby great. She was happy again, although Daniel never fully left her mind. They married after being together for a couple of years and were now expecting their first child, a girl.\n\nNot having a name picked out and only two months away from the baby being born, they spent most of their free time coming up with names. None stuck and James would joke by saying, \"Well, we can always let her name herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, Stop it.\" Abby would say slapping his arm. It was good to be happy again.\n\n#\n\nAbby slid carefully into bed trying not wake James. He had become a light sleeper in the past few weeks, mainly because of how close the baby was due to arrive. As she lay there the unopened envelope Daniel had left her suddenly came into her mind.\n\nBeing years since Abby had thought about it, she wondered if it was still in the old book she used to keep it in. Maybe I'll try to find that old book when I get up tomorrow, Abby thought as she fell asleep.\n\n#\n\nAbby was back in Desolation.\n<end of reference>\nWhat is the author trying to convey through this dream?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe author is trying to convey the fear and confusion that Abby feels in the face of this dream, and how it relates to the envelope that Daniel left her.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abThe reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nA short article in the newspaper the other day reminded me of my promise to write about garden tools from time to time.  If you didn\u2019t catch the story then try to guess what sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury and George Bernard Shaw had to do with garden spades\u2026 or rather a particular garden spade and why were they all in the news that day?   Answer at the end of this post.\n\nIn the meantime here\u2019s some more about the history of humble spade, the tool that\u2019s at the top of every list of historic garden tools.\n\nThe spade started out as a symbol that gardening is officially hard work!\n\nWhen  Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they were told: \u2018Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food\u2019 (Genesis, 3:17\u201319. New International Version).  But of course neither Adam nor Eve knew how to cultivate a garden so they had a lot to learn!\n\nThe first representation of a spade I can find is actually part of one of the oldest stained glass panels  in Canterbury cathedral.  It shows Adam hard at work using an iron-tipped spade with a mattock hanging on the branch of a nearby tree. Adam maybe be partially dressed but you\u2019ll notice he isn\u2019t wearing any shoes.\n\nAdam had to be taught how to dig, and Eve how to spin and so an angel [usually said to be the Archangel Michael] was sent down to instruct them. Images of this  were a popular subject in the Middle Ages and it was widely depicted in medieval manuscript illuminations, wall paintings and stained glass.   A window in Lincoln cathedral  depicts the angel demonstrating the art of digging, with one foot resting on a spade in the same manner as Adam, and again barefooted\u2026.\n\n\u2026but by the time Adam\u2019s son Cain was murdering his brother Abel with a handy spade, stouter footwear had been invented!\n\nThe earliest spades were made of wood, and were obviously extremely heavy and inefficient to use. The blade was usually edged with iron to give a better cutting edge, and  sometimes (as in the example below) off-set to provide a ledge for the digger\u2019s foot, but most  illustrations have a central shaft.\n \nThe spade was the gardener\u2019s main tool. The French writer Louis Liger wrote: \u2018As a soldier can\u2019t fight without his arms, so a gardener can\u2019t work without proper tools\u2019, although he also suggests that the spade is \u2018chiefly used by apprentices\u2019. But by Liger\u2019s time  this heavy clumsy instrument has been improved by making the entire blade of plate iron. It was forged with iron straps  that were bolted to the wooden handle. But this caused problems of a different sort because having an iron blade meant that the metal was going to cut into the gardeners foot as they dug. The solution was either to turn the sharp upper edge of the blade over to form a tread or to strap iron plates  to the gardeners boots or clogs.\n\nIron tools were very heavy, difficult to keep sharp &amp; liable to rust but,  as technology improved,  by end of 19thc lighter steel blades had been introduced with treads welded to iron sockets and with hollow shanks.\n\nThere have been dozens if not hundreds of different kind of spades used in this country \u2013 at one point almost every county had its own specialty .\n\nListen to this description of a spade like shovel in use in the west country. The head Gardener at Bicton near Exmouth described the local spade in 1843:  \u201ctheir spade is an ugly home-made heart-shaped bit of heavy iron, with a great socket in it; and they form the handle themselves by cutting a great lumbering stick out of a hedge, six or seven feet in length about the size of a hop pole so they can always use it without bending their backs.\n\nA similar sounding spade was used in  west Wales too. Made in a local forge until 1976 they were designed to avoid back-bending work, and were sometimes known as lazy-back shovels. They were also known as the Irish potato spade, the Lurgan shovel and the Celtic shovel.\n\nThen there much more specialised spades of all sorts\u2026.here\u2019s just a tiny selection\n\nIncidentally have you noticed the different kinds of handles you can get \u2013 apparently D or Y handles are the preference down south \u2013 but T handles are preferred in the north. Does anyone have any ideas why?\n\nElsewhere,  no handle grip is the pattern in France and Ireland \u2013 but then the French and the Irish like spades with very long shafts unlike the English\u2026 we tend to bend our backs when we dig whereas they prefer to rest the shaft on their knee or thigh\u2026.and what about the shape of the blade\u2026. flat and square? round-ended? pointed? or even, as the trend is now becoming, just ever so slightly tilted away from the vertical.  The world of the spade is obviously more complex than most of us supposed!\n\nAnd there still people trying to improve on the spade\u2026 how about this two handled version?\n\nOr this auto spade  which actually dates back 50 years or so to a company called Terrex.\n\nAnd whatever happened to the mechanical \u2018spadet\u2019 complete with sexist commentary dating from 1950 \u2026.\n\nEven today .Spear and Jackson make 25 different sorts, whilst  Bulldog still list over 20  \u2013 not including this one which is the world\u2019s largest according the Guinness book of records.  It is 3.61 meters high, and weighs 180 kg.\n\nNow the answer to the question at the start of this post.   George Bernard Shaw\u2019s garden spade, and an unpublished poem by Ray Bradbury that was inspired  by it [I joke not!] are being auctioned in Los Angeles, and expected to fetch about $5,000. According to The Times  of September 24, 2014 (p.26), Bradbury was given the spade as a Christmas present, and \u2018delighted to be holding an item that had belonged to his literary hero Bradbury wrote the poem \u201cGeorge Bernard Shaw and the Spade\u201d  to celebrate a man he described as the most important influence in literature\u2026.   A metal plaque on the spade says: With this spade Bernard Shaw planted a mulberry tree in the public garden at Great Malvern on his 80th birthday, the 26th July 1936. He then presented to Harry Batchelor Higgs, his gardener and faithful friend for 34 years.\u2019     Here is the poem\u2026 Make of it what you will!\n\nRate how useful, from 1-10 (1= not useful, 10=most useful) the spade is as a gardening tool. Explain some of the benefits of choosing a spade over other gardening tools. Keep the response under three sentences.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSpades are a helpful gardening tool. The spade is an excellent tool for gardening, and its versatility and ease of use make it a favorite among gardeners. You can use it to turn the soil, create furrows, plant, or transplant small plants and shrubs. The sharp edge of the blade allows for precise digging and can be used to dig holes of different sizes, making it a versatile tool for various gardening tasks.\u00bb\u00bb",

I know I hurt your feelings and I feel terrible about it.\nFriend: Yeah, I was pretty upset when it happened. But I appreciate you coming over to apologize.\nJavian: Yeah, of course. I just feel awful that I did that to you. It wasn't intentional, but I know that doesn't make it any better.\nFriend: No, it doesn't make it better, but like I said, I appreciate the apology. And maybe we can talk about what happened so that it doesn't happen again in the future.\nJavian: Absolutely. That's a great idea. So, where would you like to start?\nFriend: Well, I guess we can start with what made you so upset in the first place.\nJavian: Yeah, that's a good place to start. So, like I said, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. But I was just really frustrated and angry at the situation and I took it out on you. And I know that's not an excuse, but it's the only thing I can really offer up as an explanation.\nFriend: Okay, well, thank you for being honest about that.

And again, I'm really sorry about how I handled the situation. It won't happen again in the future.\nFriend: Alright, thank you for saying that. And just to be clear, if something does happen in the future where you're feeling those same emotions again, what are you going to do instead of taking them out on me?\nJavian: Well, first of all, I'll try to take a step back and assess the situation and see if there's anything else going on that might be causing me to feel that way. If it's something specific about the situation itself that's making me angry or upset, then I'll try to deal with those emotions in a more constructive way. Maybe by talking to you about it directly or venting to someone else instead of taking it out on you.\nFriend: Alright, that sounds like a good plan. And just so you know, even if it is something specific about the situation that's making you upset, venting to me is always an option too. We're friends after all and we should be able to talk about things openly without fear of hurting each other's feelings.\nJavian: Yeah absolutely! That definitely won't be a problem in the future either\n###\nPlease rewrite this dialogue to be more formal and stiff.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abJavian: I apologize for my previous behavior and any hurt feelings I may have caused. It was inappropriate of me to take out my frustration on you, and I understand that it was hurtful.\nFriend: I appreciate your apology. It is understandable that you were upset, but there are better ways to handle such emotions than taking them out on others.\nJavian: I agree. In the future, I will strive to handle my emotions in a more appropriate manner, and if I am feeling overwhelmed, I will reach out for support rather than taking it out on you.\nFriend: That sounds like a good plan. We are friends, after all, and it is important to be able to talk openly and honestly with each other.\nJavian: Indeed. Thank you for your understanding and your support.

He was born in the Kenya Province of the Colony of Kenya, now Kiambu County in the former Central Province.\n\nKiboro has won two very significant awards in his time: the Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear and the Leadership Shines Through \u2013 Africa award.\n\nCareer\n\nShell International\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Nairobi, he began his career as a Technical Sales Engineer for Shell International, and was swiftly promoted to Technical Sales Manager, in charge of the manufacturing, sales and marketing of industrial and road construction products in the East and Central Africa region.\n\nEsso Kenya\nKiboro joined Esso Kenya Ltd. in 1974 as a Supply, Planning and Economics Manager, where he started gaining both managerial and executive recognition. He gained several positions including Personnel Director and Sales\/Marketing Director.\n\nXerox Kenya\nHe joined Xerox Kenya in 1987 and was appointed the managing director of the company in 1989. He held this position until he joined the Nation Media Group in 1993.\n\nNation Media Group\nKiboro joined Nation Media Group (abbreviated as NMG) in 1993 as the managing director Designate of the Nation newspaper. At the time it's only two products were the Daily Nation and Taifa Leo (a Kenyan Kiswahili newspaper, meaning Nation Today).\n\nIn line with ongoing regional integration efforts, the NMG launched The East African in 1994, the most successful cross-border newspaper in East Africa, hitting the news-stands of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and now Rwanda. Kiboro became the Group CEO in 1995 and retained his position until his retirement in 2006.\n\nIn 1999, the NMG made their entry into the electronic media industry after many years of frustration due to policy inadequacies and hostility by the then Government of Kenya under Daniel arap Moi. Nation FM and Nation TV were formed that year. Since then, the NMG has developed into a respected conglomerate around East Africa under Kiboro's tenure. It is divided into:\n\n The Nation Newspapers Division\n The Nation Broadcasting Division\n Nation Carriers Ltd (with Courier)\n Nation Marketing &amp; Publishing:\nBusiness Directory\nThe Weekly Advertiser\nDistribution of local and international publications such as the Economist, Time, Newsweek among others\n East African Magazines\n Monitor Publications Ltd.\n Mwananchi Communications Ltd.\n\nThe NMG has also taken advantage of the communications technology explosion to send news to their subscribers, in partnership with Safaricom and Airtel, leading mobile operators in Kenya.\n\nInternational career\n\nKiboro has travelled extensively, holding numerous national, regional and international job assignments that have seen him supervise cross-national teams across continents, a vote of confidence in his abilities as a change manager. He has dedicated his life to serving his country. As evidenced by the record of posts he has held and continues to hold with a view to contributing to Kenya's growth and development. Internationally, Wilfred Kiboro is the chairman of the International Press Institute (IPI) in Kenya, the East African Business Summit and a member of the International Who's Who of Professionals. He also sits on The Rhodes Trust in Kenya as Honorary chairman and is a member of the International Organisation of Employers' Enterprise Advisory Group. He launched numerous environmental and humanitarian efforts during his tenure at NMG, two key ones being:\n The launching of the Aberdare Forest Fund in 2002 \n The launching of the Nation Turkana Relief Fund in 1999\/2000\n\nMajor awards\n Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear\n Leadership Shines Through \u2013 Africa\n ICT Hall of Fame \u2013 2007 Lifetime Inductee\n\nRetirement\nKiboro retired as the Group CEO of the NMG in 2006, but still works there as the chairman of their board of directors. The NMG labelled him as their 'Mentor, Father, Team Leader and Champion'. His dream for the NMG in the future is that it will diversify its activities to some 12 African countries within the next ten years. He also works as the Chairman of Wilfay Investments Limited and serves as a non-executive director of East African Breweries Limited and Standard Chartered Bank Kenya.\n\nPersonal life\nKiboro and his wife Fatuma live in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nSources \n Profile at The Media Center @ API\n Profile at Bloomberg Businessweek\n Profile at Nation Media Group \u2013 Board of Directors\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nFrom the text given, extract the events that Kiboro launched for environmental and humanitarian reasons.

What are the benefits and drawbacks of this technology?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00ab3D scanning is the technology used to create 3D models of scanned objects. It works by emitting an array of light pulses onto an object and measuring the time it takes for the light to bounce back to a sensor. The sensor then creates a 3D model based on the shape of the object and its surroundings.\n\nThe benefits of 3D scanning include its accuracy, versatility, and the ability to create highly detailed models. It can be used to scan a wide range of objects, from small objects like jewelry to large objects like buildings. It is also relatively fast and can be used in a variety of settings, including on-site and in the studio.\n\nHowever, 3D scanning also has some drawbacks. It can be expensive, requiring specialized equipment and software. It can also be time-consuming, requiring a high level of skill and experience to get the best results. Additionally, the resulting 3D models can be large and difficult to share and store.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abRead this for context:\n<start of reference>\nChances are \u2013 unless you live in Los Angeles \u2013 the only time you hear about Scientology is when it\u2019s connected with a Hollywood celebrity.\n\nYet there\u2019s a lot more to this religion than just its ties to Tinseltown. Scientology is probably one of the most successful new American faiths to have emerged in the past century. But despite its success \u2013 and like a lot of other belief systems \u2013 what Scientologists believe and how they perceive a higher power is often misunderstood.\n\nReligious scholar Reza Aslan explores the origin and central ideas of this faith on his CNN show, \u201cBeliever.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the basics about Scientology:\n\nScientology describes itself as a religion that was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nAt the core of Scientology is a belief that each human has a reactive mind that responds to life\u2019s traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality. Members of the religion submit to a process called auditing to find the sources of this trauma, reliving those experiences in an attempt to neutralize them and reassert the primacy of the analytic mind, working toward a spiritual state called \u201cclear.\u201d\nThe process involves a device called E-meter, which Scientologists say measures the body\u2019s electric flow as an auditor asks a series of questions they say reveals sources of trauma.\n\n\u201cAuditing uses processes - exact sets of questions asked or directions given by an auditor to help a person locate areas of spiritual distress, find out things about himself and improve his condition,\u201d according to the Church of Scientology\u2019s website.\n\nThe church goes on to say, \u201cScience is something one does, not something one believes in.\u201d\n\nAuditing purports to identify spiritual distress from a person\u2019s current life and from past lives. Scientologists believe each person is an immortal being, a force that believers call a thetan.\n\n\u201cYou move up the bridge to freedom by working toward being an \u2018Operating Thetan,\u2019 which at the highest level transcends material law,\u201d says David Bromley, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cYou occasionally come across people in Scientology who say they can change the material world with their mind.\u201d\n\nBromley and other scholars say the church promotes the idea of an ancient intergalactic civilization in which millions of beings were destroyed and became what are known as \u201cbody thetans,\u201d which continue to latch onto humans and cause more trauma.\n\nAdvanced Scientologists confront body thetans through more auditing.\n\nBromley says the church discloses that cosmic history only to more advanced Scientologists. The church\u2019s media affairs department did not respond to requests for comment to this story.\n\nIn a 2008 CNN interview, church spokesman Tommy Davis was asked whether the basic tenet of the Church of Scientology was to rid the body of space alien parasites.\n\n\u201cDoes that sound silly to you?\u201d laughed Davis. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s unrecognizable to me. \u2026 People should really come to the church and find out for themselves what it is.\u201d\n\nL. Ron Hubbard was the founder of Scientology. Born in Nebraska in 1911, Hubbard was the son of a U.S. Navy officer who circled the globe with his family, according to Scientology expert J. Gordon Melton, a fellow at Baylor University\u2019s Institute for Studies in Religion who writes about Scientology on the religion website Patheos.\n\nHubbard attended the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., but left before graduating to launch a career as a fiction writer, gravitating toward science fiction.\nAfter serving in World War II, Hubbard published a series of articles and then a book on a what he described as a new approach to mental health, which he called Dianetics. His book by the same name quickly became a best-seller.\n\nThe success provoked Hubbard to establish a foundation that began to train people in his auditing techniques. In 1954, the first Church of Scientology opened in Los Angeles, with other churches opening soon after. Hubbard died in 1986. The church is now led by David Miscavige.\n\nMany groups and individuals have challenged Scientology\u2019s legitimacy as a religion.\n\nScientologists have faced opposition from the medical community over the religion\u2019s claims about mental health, from the scientific community over its claims about its E-meters and from other religious groups about its status as a religion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part therapy, part religion, part UFO group,\u201d says Bromley. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of things that\u2019s unlike any other religious group out there.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, the Internal Revenue Service denied the Scientologists\u2019 attempts to be declared a church with tax-exempt status. But the IRS granted them that status in 1993.\n\nMany members say the church is largely about self-improvement.\n\n\u201cWhat I believe in my own life is that it\u2019s a search for how I can do things better, whether it\u2019s being a better man or a better father or finding ways for myself to improve,\u201d Tom Cruise told Playboy magazine. \u201cIndividuals have to decide what is true and real for them.\u201d\n\nL. Ron Hubbard rejected psychiatry and psychiatric drugs because he said they interfered with the functioning of the rational mind. Scientologists continue to promote that idea.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\u2019s website says that \u201cthe effects of medical and psychiatric drugs, whether painkillers, tranquilizers or \u2018antidepressants,\u2019 are as disastrous\u201d as illicit drugs.\n\nThat\u2019s a matter of considerable dispute.\nThe Church of Scientology says it has 10,000 churches, missions and groups operating in 167 countries, with 4.4 million more people signing up every year.\n\nScholars say that, despite the global proliferation of church buildings, the membership numbers are much lower than the church claims, likely in the hundreds of thousands. Several of the church\u2019s followers are Hollywood celebrities.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nClassify whether the article was accurate or inaccurate regarding Scientology. (ACCURATE\/INACCURATE)\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAccurate\n\nThe article accurately provides information about the origin, beliefs, and practices of Scientology. It accurately states that the core belief of Scientology is that each human has a reactive mind that responds to life's traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality. Members of the religion submit to a process called auditing to find the sources of this trauma, reliving those experiences in an attempt to neutralize them and reassert the primacy of the analytic mind, working toward a spiritual state called \"clear.\"\u00bb\u00bb",

Despite support services, working in this space can have negative impacts on wellbeing. This paper explores the experiences and perceptions held by police officers and staff involved in CSAE investigations in the United Kingdom, regarding work-related wellbeing support and barriers to accessing such support.\n\nMethod: A sample of 661 serving police officers and staff working in CSAE investigations participated in a United Kingdom-wide \u2018Protecting the Protectors\u2019 survey. We analysed quantitative and qualitative responses relating to participants\u2019 experiences and perceptions regarding three main areas: (1) availability, usage and helpfulness of existing work-based well-being support; (2) barriers to accessing support; and (3) desired support services.\n\nFindings: Five interconnected themes emerged from the qualitative data that represented participants\u2019 experiences and views of work-based wellbeing support and the barriers to accessing it. These were \u2018Lack of trust\u2019, \u2018Stigma\u2019, \u2018Organisational approaches to wellbeing\u2019, \u2018Support services\u2019, and \u2018Internalised barriers\u2019. The findings suggest that whilst respondents were aware of work-based support, they indicated most frequently that they \u2018never or almost never\u2019 used them. Respondents also identified barriers to accessing support, which related to a perception of a critical or judgmental workplace culture and indicating a lack of trust in their organisations.\"Conclusion: Stigma regarding mental ill health has a pervasive and harmful impact on emotional health and wellbeing of police officers and staff involved in CSAE investigations, which creates a sense of lack of emotional safety. Therefore, eliminating stigma and creating a workplace culture that explicitly values and prioritises the emotional health and wellbeing of the workforce would improve the wellbeing of officers and staff. Police organisations could further improve CSAE teams\u2019 wellbeing by developing a continuum of care which is available to workers from recruitment to the end of the role, training managers and supervisors to better support CSAE teams, improving workplace practices, and ensuring high quality, specialist support services are readily and consistently available across forces.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nPlease extract from the text the main reasons, identified by police officers and staff, that hinder them from accessing wellbeing support in their role dealing with child sexual abuse and exploitation investigations.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe main reasons identified by police officers and staff are:\n\n1. Lack of trust in their organizations\n2. Stigma regarding mental ill health\n3. Organizational approaches to wellbeing\n4. Support services\n5. Internalized barriers\u00bb\u00bb",

Her eyes are closed and she wants to speak but her tongue is fat and useless in her mouth. She is not scared now though; the drugs are working on her anxiety and dulling the edge that had threatened to slice her wide open.\n\nThe last thing she remembers is the constant pressure of the hand on her arm. The hand that never lets go.\n\n### Chapter Two\n\nBRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS in through cracks in the window blinds. The girl is aware of the light on her eyelids before she even opens them, and she stretches her toes out, luxuriating in the pleasant warmth on her face. She yawns and rolls onto her back, stretching her arms wide to the sides. She's very stiff for some reason, and this bed is not as comfortable as she'd like.\n\nHer eyes open and take in her surroundings. Her breath stops in her chest, and a knot of confusion and fear starts twisting and tangling in her stomach. She feels like her brain is covered in a layer of soft white gauze, inhibiting her ability to reason out what's going on, but slowly the pieces click together and she understands what has happened.\n\nShe's in the hospital. They don't know what happened, but they know she hit her head. She's okay, but no one-not even her-has a clue as to who she is and how she got here.\n\n_Keep it together,_ she thinks. _You've already gone catatonic over this, and there's no need to do it again._\n\nIt's not perfect, but it helps her relax a little. She doesn't know what kind of person she is, but she decides that she's not a helpless little girl and that there's no use in freaking herself out over something she can't control. _That's one upside to losing your memory,_ she supposes. _You get to decide what kind of a person you want to be and don't have to deal with all of your old hang ups._\n\nThe downside to waking up in a hospital bed is not knowing how long you've been unconscious or how long it's been since you last had a chance to pee. She reaches down under the blanket and tentatively feels around between her legs. Thankfully, she doesn't feel any tubes or indications that they've given her a catheter. As much as she doesn't really want to get out of bed right now, she really doesn't want to have to pee in a tube while lying in bed.\n\nShe props herself up slowly and rises to a sitting position. White fuzz swarms in around the edges of her vision, and she has to close her eyes and breathe slow and deep to keep from passing out. Her brain feels like it is one size too big for her skull, and there's a sharpness cutting through all of that somewhere in the back of her head. A few deep breaths and the moment passes.\n\nOpening her eyes, she's able to swing her legs out over the edge of the bed, and for a moment she just sits there. With the way she feels, she's not sure if she'll make it to the toilet, but the need to pee is urgently overriding her concern over falling into a heap on the floor of her room. She pushes off the edge of the bed and feels her toes touch the floor.\n\nThe hard vinyl surface is cold on her bare feet, but with one hand on the hospital bed, she's able to stand without falling over. As she lets go of the bed railing to take her first step, she realizes that she's still hooked up to the IV. She doesn't know how she knows this, or where the memory comes from, but she has seen this sort of thing in movies before. She moves clumsily around the edge of the bed, grabs the metal IV frame pole, and tugs the whole thing towards herself.\n\nThe wheeled IV cart is the perfect stabilizer, and she leans heavily on it as she shuffles towards the only other door in the room that she has to assume leads to the restroom. Pushing her IV ahead of her, she wonders how it can be that she has these images of seeing people do this sort of thing on television or in movies, yet she can't remember anything about her own life. It's like she has access to giant catalogue of accumulated knowledge, but someone has ripped out all the pages specific to her life, friends, and family.\n\nPulling open the restroom door, she looks at the small space, then back at her IV cart.\n<end of reference>\nExtract the girl's feelings, thoughts, and actions after waking up.
