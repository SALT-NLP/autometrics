It was a cute home for a single or a couple\u2014rustic, cozy, and inviting except for the father standing across the room, maybe ten feet from him. Everything about his body language screamed that he wouldn't be pushed around and wouldn't stand for anything happening on his property or to his daughters. His hands were on his hips, and he was looking everywhere except at Jerry.\n\nIt was a motion Jerry recognized. Robert was gathering his thoughts carefully. Jerry hadn't noticed the belt buckle on his faded blue jeans before, a cowboy riding a bronc. He wondered whether the man had rodeoed. Maybe one day he could ask. Robert had strong forearms, which he could see from where his light blue shirt sleeves were rolled up. His scuffed boots appeared to have had years of use.\n\nJerry felt he should say something. He thought at least five minutes had passed, but he knew in reality it had been maybe ten seconds since Taz and Ivy had walked out the door.\n\n\"What exactly are your intentions with my daughter?\" Robert said. Okay, there it was. Not what he expected, but then, he realized he was stepping into a family that had values. This was an area he wasn't familiar with at all.\n\n\"I want to get to know Taz\u2014\"\n\nRobert cleared his throat, interrupting him, and gestured to the sofa. \"Oh, I saw that much.\"\n\nHe was taking this the wrong way. \"Rob\u2014Mr. Parker,\" Jerry said. He'd almost called him by his first name. Good Lord, what was he thinking? The sharp look had been all he needed for correction. \"I want to date your daughter. Yes, what you saw was personal. I wasn't disrespecting her. I really like her.\" He wanted to say he loved her, but it was too soon. He needed more time. \"She's everything to me, and the moment I met her, I realized she was special. She's a woman I want to get to know. I want to have something that's more...not a fling.\" He stressed this, because for the first time in his life he felt as if he were stumbling around and couldn't put anything coherent together. He was known for clear communication and thinking on the spot in the most dire of circumstances, but not now.\n\n\"I see. So you want to date my daughter or sleep with her?\"\n\nRight to the point. Both, though the second would likely get a fist planted in his mouth if he admitted it. He couldn't help liking this man, this father who was a bigger presence than any guard dog could have been. \"Eventually, yes, I want it all with Taz. I'm not looking for an affair. I want something real, permanent. That's why I'm here, and I'm sorry you walked in on what you did.\"\n\n\"But you're not sorry for what you did?\" Robert tossed right back.\n\nHe could lie, but that would have been a mistake. This man was watching his every move, and he was sure he could read everything\u2014a lie, the truth, an omission. \"No, I'm not. If you want to hit me for that, go ahead. But Taz means something to me, and...\" He wasn't going to talk about sex or anything like that with her father, and neither was he willing to talk about his feelings for a woman he was only beginning to figure out.\n\n\"Let me get this straight. You want to date my daughter, you want a relationship with her, yet you have her nearly naked after knowing her for five minutes. You trying to bullshit me? Why is it you needed to come all this way? I'm sure there are plenty of women where you are in Denver.\n###\n\nPlease rewrite this text to have a more relaxed and confident tone.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAlright, let's get this straight.

In 1985 the Dutch Government commissioned him to draft a feasibility study on the creation of a UNU Institute to specialize in the social and economic aspects of new technologies. The report was presented to UNU in 1987 and formed the basis for setting up the new Institute in 1990. Prof Cooper led the Institute from 1990 until 2000. He was succeeded by Prof Dr Lynn Mytelka (2000-2004), Prof Dr Luc Soete (2004-2012), Prof Dr Bart Verspagen (2012- 2020). The current director is Prof. Dr. Bartel Van de Walle.\n\nFollowing the integration of the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (MGSoG) in December 2010, the institute now covers all aspects of governance in domestic and global organizations, from risk assessment to policy analysis, design and evaluation. In its enlarged form, UNU-MERIT functions as a research centre and graduate school. The Institute offers M.Sc in Public Policy &amp; Human Development with 8 different specializations. UNU-MERIT is a 'UN think tank' addressing a broad range of policy questions on comprehensive innovation for sustainable development.\n\nThe institute was based in a historic building in the centre of Maastricht near the city's main square, the Vrijthof till August 2015. In September 2015 the institute moved to a new location in Boschstraat in the newly developed Sphinx Quarter.\n\nPhD Programmes\nThe Institute has two PhD Programmes. The full-time programme allows candidates to conduct independent research on Innovation, Economics and Governance for Development. The Dual Career Training Programme to obtain a PhD in Governance and Policy Analysis (GPAC\u00b2) allows external PhD candidates to devote part of their working time to scientific research whilst continuing their full-time employment.\n\nMaster in Public Policy &amp; Human Development\nUNU-MERIT, in partnership with Maastricht University, offers a Master of Science in Public Policy &amp; Human Development (MPP). The programme awards a double degree, one from each partner University. The MPP is accredited by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO) and received the official EAPAA accreditation by the European Association for Public Administration Accreditation.\nThe Programme has seven specializations which are offered in collaboration with partner universities and international organisations\n\nWikipedia General Survey\nIn January 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced plans to conduct a general survey of all Wikipedians. They hired the Collaborative Creativity Group of UNU-MERIT for the job, which published preliminary results in April 2009. Though initially intended to track reasons for editor decline, an unexpected result of the study was to uncover a significant difference between the number of male editors versus the number of female editors. Though this was first definitely established with the 2011 editor survey, the UNU-MERIT survey can be seen as the first signal of Wikipedia's Gendergap.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nWhich of the following best describes the type of organization described in the text?\n- Nonprofit organization\n- For-profit corporation\n- Government agency\n- Other (please specify)\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abOther (please specify)\u00bb\u00bb",

However, to enjoy gunfights to the fullest and not get farmed by their opponents, players need the knowledge of the best guns in the game and their most effective loadouts.\n\nThis article will dive into the best loadout for the Lachmann-556, which is regarded by many as one of the best all-rounder assault rifles (ARs) currently available in Modern Warfare 2.\n\nHow to unlock the Lachmann-556 in Modern Warfare 2\n\nHow to unlock Lachmann 556 (Image via YouTube\/Hero)\n\nBefore diving into the best build for Lachmann-556 in Modern Warfare 2, it is important to assess the unlock condition for the assault rifle. To access the Lachmann-556, players must first unlock the Lachmann 762 by reaching Rank 16. Once a player has unlocked the Lachmann-762, they need to level up the gun to level 13 to unlock the receiver for the Lachmann-556.\n\nHowever, players are advised to unlock the entire Lachmann family tech tree to get their hands on the best attachments for Lachmann-556.\n\nBest attachments for Lachmann-556 in Modern Warfare 2\n\nAmong the competent assault rifle in Modern Warfare 2, the Lachmann 556 is among the best in the business. Plenty of players are already considering this rifle as the successor to Grau 5.56 from the previous title of the series.\n\nThis AR is suitable for engaging enemies at close to mid-range, sporting a base fire rate of 741 rounds per minute and a muzzle velocity of 590m\/s. However, to get a better performance from the gun and deliberately get a better TTK, one has to equip the gun with the following attachments:\n\nMuzzle - Echoline GS-X\n\nBarrel - Lach-12 Barrel\n\nOptics - Chronen Mini Red-dot\n\nUnderbarrel - FSS Sharkfin 90\n\nMagazine - 40-Round Mag\n\nModern Warfare 2 Lachmann-556 loadout (Image via YouTube\/Hero)\n\nThe setup for Lachmann-556 is mainly optimized for improved recoil control and stability while firing.\n\nThe Echoline GS-X muzzle improves the recoil smoothness, thus reducing the visual recoil of the gun while firing. Along with this, the muzzle attachments also reduce the sound produced by the gun when the bullet leaves the barrel.\n\nThe Lach-12 is one of the smaller barrels available for the gun. It increases the weapon's aim and movement speed by a significant margin. This barrel will improve the response time of the operators and make the gun snappier.\n\nThe Sharkfin underbarrel will improve the aim idle stability of the gun, thus reducing the gun's sway while the operators are aiming down the sight.\n\nAlong with these three attachments, the AR must be equipped with a 40-round mag to improve the weapon's performance. The gun eats through bullets quite quickly due to its high fire rate. As such, an extended magazine is necessary for optimal performance.\n\nLastly, Chronen Mini Red-dot provides a clean red-dot sight for the gun and helps aim in on targets in close to medium-range gunfight engagements. However, players can choose any other sight available according to their preference. Choosing optics is a very personal choice for players, and they should always use whatever they are comfortable with.\n\nThis is the best build for Lachmann-556 in Modern Warfare 2. It will provide users with an assault rifle with a sub-machine gun-like mobility and response time, making it one of the best ARs for any of the smaller maps of the title.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nWhich genre does this text belong to?\n- Action\n- Adventure\n- Sci-Fi\n- Thriller\n- Other\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abAction\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nConversely, there is a lack of qualitative studies exploring the risk and protection factors. For this reason, in this study we decided to use a qualitative approach to explore \u201cmore up close\u201d this kind of organizational context and to keep together the different levels in systemic terms in order to identify \u2013 according to professionals\u2019 perceptions \u2013 resource factors (in order to leverage these aspects) and fatigue factors (to identify them and treat them). Three Italian Care Homes were involved and the interview\u2019s sample was composed of 45 professionals \u2013 15 nurses, 30 total Patient Care Assistants (PCAs) and Auxiliary Care Assistants (ACAs), of these, 17 males and 28 females, with an average age of 43 years (SD = 0.78) \u2013 selected using a sampling of maximum variability. From the analysis of the materials there seem to be four profiles of the professionals involved. Implications to ensure a functional human resource management are discussed for the purpose of promote the well-being of the various professionals, and, as a result, an increasing quality of service.\n\nThe present study aims to offer a contribution to the understanding of the care professions that work in Care Homes [in Italy, Residenze Sanitarie Assistenziali (RSA)] because due to the complex challenges they face they are likely to experience various forms of physical and emotional malaise.\n\nFirst evidence related to the attention for care professions concerns the incremental aging of the Italian population: 200,000 non-self-sufficient seniors are guests in residential structures, 2.5 million live with their families, but 4.7 million seniors would opt to live in residences if their quality of life improved. Furthermore, the increased age of the guests welcomed in Care Homes determines a physical and mental health situation characterized by co-occurrence of illnesses, psychological and behavioral instability, fragility, and therefore the work required of operators is focused on the preservation of the remaining capacity, the management of chronic illness and assistance in activities of daily living. Another element to consider is the process of corporatization that increasingly impacts Italian care settings, implying that professionals are supposed to be able to optimize time, resources, and costs. At the same time, there is a demand by family members and guests for a higher quality of services and a consequent increase in the degree of competitiveness, pressure within this sector and demands in terms of emotional and physical investment.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a growing interest in the study and understanding of professions in geriatric care settings. In the literature there is a prevalence of cohort, cross-sectional and comparative studies that offer an overview in terms of indicators \u2013 at the individual or group or organizational level \u2013 concerning the potential development of situations of professional malaise. Studies that examined the individual dimension have shown that a lack of sense of control and mastery over one\u2019s working conditions and fear of making mistakes represent risk factors for operators. It is also true that the ability to exercise decision-making autonomy with respect to the assumption of one\u2019s role can represent not only an important protection factor, but also a stimulus in terms of performance and skills development. Studies on elements related to the group show that poor levels of coordination and integration between teams and roles, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships are factors that affect the well-being of the people who make up the working team. This is in line with the assumption that social support from colleagues acts as a \u201cbuffer\u201d against the negative effects of the work on one\u2019s health and well-being. Additionally, the professionals who work in Care Homes very often have to negotiate with the role expectations of guests and their families, as well as with those of colleagues and the organization. In fact, the transition to a care home for a family is much more than a change in location, and often family members pour out all their anxieties and fears related to this stage of the family cycle on operators. More infrequent are the studies on elements related to the organizational level. They showed the influence that culture and climate have on operator comfort. More precisely, some studies have shown that elements like a low degree of individual responsibility attributed to the individual operator, a lack of open and clear communication, a rigid leadership, the lack of spaces and channels for discussion are more likely to be associated with episodes of stress, job dissatisfaction, and poor quality of work. Similarly, a correlation has been demonstrated between organizational cultures and climates oriented toward encouraging and promoting the processes of empowerment, communication and participation and the influence these have on the quality of life in Care Homes both for operators and for guests. To this must be added the uncertainty and insecurity related to the continuous changes that affect the healthcare world, and the quantity and quality of information made available to professionals may contribute positively or negatively to well-being. In summary, analyzing the literature we can see that most works are quantitative research focused mostly on just one analysis level. Conversely, there are fewer qualitative studies that extensively explore the risk and protection factors. For these reasons, this study therefore aims to \u201cgive a voice\u201d to the operators exploring efforts and resources that they perceive and represent to be a priority for their profession in order to further the knowledge of this phenomenon and identify lines of action in support of the professionals and organizational effectiveness. In light of our experience researching and working with organizations, it was decided to approach the complexity of these contexts by adopting a psycho-sociological approach to the study of professional roles. This means simultaneously keeping in mind and considering three different levels:\n\n(1) The individual level (the stories and the personal and professional experiences of the participants).\n\n(2) The group level (the operation of the work group, relationships with colleagues).\n\n(3) The organizational level (the operation of the organization as a whole and its organizational culture).\n\nInstruction:\nClassify the given sentences from the article as facts or opinions.

He was the original drummer of rock band Dire Straits and played on their first four albums, which included hit singles such as \"Sultans of Swing\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Private Investigations\". Withers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.\n\nBiography \nTaught by childhood friend Richard Storer, Withers first played a drum in the Boys' Brigade in his home city of Leicester. He became a professional musician at the age of 17, in a band called the Primitives. This was followed by a band called Spring who had a record contract but little success; they released one album on the RCA label. In the mid-1970s Withers was a house drummer at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth, Wales. He played on records by Dave Edmunds, Hobo, the John Dummer Band and the Gary Fletcher Band, amongst others.\n\nHis nickname has been subject to some variations in spelling. During his time with Spring, he was billed as Pique Withers. He is billed as Pic Withers on his appearance on the second Brewers Droop album.\n\nWithers has also studied at Drumtech drum school in London.\n\nDire Straits \nWithers met Mark Knopfler circa 1976 in north London. Knopfler called around to the house Withers was living in to borrow Simon Cowe's reel to reel tape recorder, and recorded some music with Withers that day. Withers was briefly a member of folk-rock outfit Magna Carta in 1977, but once Dire Straits gained a recording contract, he turned to drumming for that band full-time.\n\nHis style with Dire Straits is distinctive for being restrained, favouring sparse snare drum and hi-hat combinations rather than heavy beats, speed and pyrotechnic flourishes. He played on the Dire Straits albums Dire Straits (1978), Communiqu\u00e9 (1979), Making Movies (1980) and Love Over Gold (1982).\n\nWithers left Dire Straits in the summer of 1982, soon after completing the Love Over Gold sessions. In a 2021 interview in which he was asked why he left, Withers said that the band was becoming too loud, he was tired of the treadmill, and he wanted to try new things. His replacement in Dire Straits was Terry Williams, also a Dave Edmunds sideman.\n\nIn 2021, Withers re-surfaced with a new rhythm and blues band called 'Slim Pickin's'.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Dire Straits\n\nWith others \n Spring, Spring\n How Long Is Forever, Prelude\n Slow Train Coming, Bob Dylan\n Giant From The Blue, Gary Fletcher Band\n Sleepwalking, Gerry Rafferty\n A Rare Conundrum, Bert Jansch\n The Booze Brothers, Brewers Droop\n\nYour task is to:\nWhich of the following topics does the biography of David \"Pick\" Withers fall under?\n- Music\n- History\n- Literature\n- Science\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMusic\u00bb\u00bb",

Surprised, the man started to turn as a puukko was slowly drawn across his neck. Simultaneously, before the hapless guard could cry out, a hand was placed over his mouth.\n\nFollowing the slight snick sound of the blade being stowed in a metal holster, another arm appeared and wrapped itself around the soldier's torso as he struggled against it. The Russian tried desperately to break the grasp of the man that had slit his throat. This went on for about a minute as his efforts became weaker and weaker. Finally, the light left the guard's eyes and what remained of him was quietly lowered to the ground.\n\nBehind the guard, was a slender form dressed much like Hale in white overcoat and gray trousers. Recognition dawned on Hale's features, as he looked at the man in the silvery moon light. Hale whispered, \"Corporal Pekka?\"\n\nThe Corporal's well lined and weathered face crinkled as it broke into a smile, \"Keep quiet, there are perhaps a half dozen Russian pigs within ear shot. Can you walk?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Hale replied.\n\nCorporal Pekka nodded in response. He paused a moment to clean the blood of his puukko using the slain guard's coat and then set about sawing at the rope around Hale's wrists. The snoring outside the tent continued unabated as the corporal finished up freeing Hale's arms. With a faint snap, the ropes around his wrists loosened and fell away.\n\nThe corporal handed Hale the puukko and said, \"Take care of your legs. I'm going to search this fool.

In 1972, the doctor's degree (summa cum laude) has been conferred on him by the Aerospace Institute of the Technical University of Berlin for his research and thesis on hydrostatic bearings as frictionless suspension in navigation instruments.\nIn addition, in 1965 through 1973, he was responsible for the development of inertial navigation sensors and gyrostabilizers for satellites at Teldix (now Rockwell Collins, Inc.) in Heidelberg (Germany).\nIn the following years he worked at ESTEC, the main technology development and test centre for spacecraft and space technology of the European Space Agency (ESA) at Noordwijk, The Netherlands, on attitude control and precision pointing problems and became later Head of the Navigation and Guidance Section. There, he and his teams at ESA and in industry developed basic techniques and technologies for automated rendezvous and docking of spacecraft, which are being applied in international space projects, such as the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV),  the first West-European spacecraft that docked automatically to the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2008.\n\nSince his retirement in 2002, Fehse supports European space companies as a consultant and adviser in rendezvous and coupling issues. These include rendezvous with non-cooperative targets (e.g. removal of space debris in Low Earth Orbit) and servicing of geostationary satellites disturbed by the effects of solar pressure. Furthermore, he continues to give specific lectures at universities and international institutes and industry.\n\nFehse is internationally known for his work in the area of automated rendezvous and docking\/berthing of spacecraft. In addition to his numerous publications, his handbook on Automated Rendezvous and Docking of Spacecraft has been widely recognized. In 2011, his handbook has been translated into the Chinese language.\n\nHe contributed to the Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering - issued in 2010 - by writing the section on close proximity rendezvous and docking (RVD). and - in 2013 - he wrote \"Safety of Rendezvous and Docking Operations\" as part of the Handbook on \"Safety Design for Space Operations\"\n\nPublications (short list)\nB.

Due to a very small population base, the details of storms affecting Arizona during the first half of the 20th century are sketchy at best, and the following list is largely limited to events that have occurred since 1960.\n\n1916 Severe Winter Floods\n\nIn early 1916, the flow on the Gila River around Yuma is estimated to have reached 200,000 cubic feet per second; a record which probably will never be broken as reservoirs on the Gila, Salt, and Verde rivers now greatly reduce the flow at Yuma even during the most serious flooding. Inflation adjusted damage was in the millions of dollars.\n\n1962 Tropical Storm Claudia\n\nSeptember 25 through 27 1962: The remains of Tropical Storm Claudia causes severe flash flooding in and around Tucson.Up to seven inches of rain fell in the desert just west of Tucson near the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum. Flood waters inundated Marana and Sells.\n\n1964 San Xavier Tornado\n\nAugust 27: A tornado hit the San Xavier Mission Village west of Tucson. Two deaths and 9 injuries were reported. Four homes were destroyed.\n\n1965 Heavy Winter Rain and Snow\n\nDecember 1965: Heavy rainfall and melting snow forced a release of water into the Salt River. All roads across the Salt River in metro Phoenix were washed out and all bridges at least partially damaged. Monthly precipitation exceeded 12 inches at several mountain stations.\n\n1967 Storm of the Century - 86 inches of Snow at Flagstaff\n\nDecember 12-20 1967: A huge snow storm paralyzed northern Arizona and brought snow to much of the state. In reality, it was two storms with the second following closely on the heels of the first. During these nine days, 86.0 inches of snow fell at Flagstaff. At Winslow, where average annual snowfall is 11.2 inches, 39.6 inches of snow was reported. On December 14, a state record 38.0 inches fell in 24 hours at the Heber Ranger Station. Snowfall totals over the Rim country included 102.7 inches at Hawley Lake, 99 inches at Greer, 91.5 inches at the Heber Ranger Station, 87.3 inches at Crown King, 77.0 inches at Payson, 46.0 inches at Prescott, 35.2 inches at Sedona, and 31.0 inches at the south rim of the Grand Canyon. The Navajo Nation was extremely hard hit as two to three feet of snow fell across the reservation. Window Rock measured 33.5 inches. People on the reservation were instructed to use ashes from their stoves and fireplaces to write distress signals in the snow that could be spotted from the air. Eight people died of exposure.\n\nSouthern Arizona did not escape the measurable snow as even the lowest deserts saw accumulation. Amounts include 84.0 inches on Mount Lemmon, 27.5 inches at Miami,17.7 inches at Wilcox,11.0 inches at Safford,5.0 inches at Wickenburg,3.8 inches at Douglas,3.0 inches at Ajo, and 1.6 inches at Tucson. And, perhaps the most surprising report of all, 2.5 inches at Gila Bend.\n\n 1970 The Labor Day Storm of 1970 -Tropical Storm Norma\n\nSeptember 4 and 5 1970:The Labor Day storm of 1970. The remains of tropical storm Norma brought severe flooding to Arizona and became the deadliest storm in Arizona history. There were 23 deaths in central Arizona including 14 from flash flooding on Tonto Creek in the vicinity of Kohl's Ranch.Total rainfall at Workman Creek (about 30 miles north of Globe in the Sierra Ancha mountains) was 11.92 inches, with 11.40 inches falling in 24 hours. Other rainfall amounts included 9.09 at Upper Parker Creek, 8.74 at Mount Lemmon, 8.44 at Sunflower, 8.08 at Kitt Peak, 7.12 at the Tonto Creek Fish Hatchery, and 7.01 inches at Crown King.\n\n1971 Tempe Tornado\n\nAugust 30: An F-1 tornado touched down south of Tempe and moved north into the city. Eyewitnesses reported what appeared to be a huge dust devil reaching into the clouds before the tornado struck. An estimated 100 homes were damaged with most of the damage to roofs, windows, and block walls. Very heavy rain and hail accompanied the tornado, and 41 minor injuries were reported due to flying glass. Roof damage to the McClintock High School gymnasium allowed water to pour onto the gymnasium floor causing severe damage.\n\n 1972 Phoenix's Worst Flash Flood\n\nJune 22 1972: Severe flash flooding occurred in metro Phoenix. Three to five inches of rain fell over much of the north half of the Phoenix metro area. Flood waters inundated hundreds of homes in Phoenix and Scottsdale. This is particularly notable because normal June rainfall in Phoenix is only 0.13 inches.\n\n 1972 Hurricane Joanne\n\nOctober 4 through 7 1972: The remains of Hurricane Joanne brought heavy rain and flooding to much of the state. It was the first documented time that a tropical storm reached Arizona with its cyclonic circulation intact. Heavy rains fell over much of the state with severe flooding in the Clifton, Duncan, and Safford areas.\n\n 1976 Hurricane Kathleen\n\nOn September 10 and 11: The remains of Hurricane Kathleen moved across Baja and into southern California near El Centro. With its circulation still intact, tropical storm force winds produced considerable damage in Yuma. Sustained winds exceeded 50 mph, and gusts as high as 76 mph were reported in Yuma. One man was killed as a 75 foot palm tree crashed onto his mobile home. Severe flooding also occurred in Mohave county. Residual moisture brought more severe thunderstorms to the state on September 24 and 25. The Tucson area was particularly hard hit with flash flooding and golf ball sized hail. Hail covered the ground to a depth of 5 inches on Mount Lemmon.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nFrom the text provided, extract only the storms with injuries or deaths.

The figure hadn't been back to her apartment since that night, because she protected her place with crystals and spells, but at that moment, she felt like he was there.\n\nThen she spotted him. The tall hooded figure stood in the corner, motionless, in a black robe; the hood shadow his face, and all Lin saw were his white hands.\n\nLin felt tense all over.\n\nMilton stopped talking, and asked, \"Are you alright? What are you looking at?\"\n\nHe turned in his seat, and Lin realized that she was the only one who could see the figure.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nOver dinner, Milton told her about his childhood. He'd grown up in Blackthorn and was passionate about art. Milton was an only child when both his parents died, leaving him enough money to take care of himself.\n\nAfter he'd talked a bit about himself, Lin asked about something she'd heard again, earlier that day at the caf\u00e9.\n\n\"Do you think it's true that there is a group called the Blackthorn Contention?\"\n\nMilton's eyes flickered in the light. For the first time since they'd met, he seemed at a loss for words. Lin could see the wheels turning in his head. He was desperately trying to figure out what to say.\n\n\"Did I say something wrong?\"\n\n\"No. I was just wondering why you asked me that. The whole town has gone mad, talking about some contention group.\"\n\n\"I heard some students talking about it. In keeping with Miles request to stay vigilant, I was wondering if I should worry about the so called Contention. I asked you because you're knowledgeable about many things that happen in Blackthorn. I'm still relatively new here.\"\n\nHe took a sip from his wine glass and said, \"I don't know anything about the Contention, but I hear it's a group of rivals whose aim is to stop the Wackens.\"\n\nLin took a bite of her bread, and then asked, \"So why didn't they help when the city was being attacked the other night? Why don't they come out of hiding and help the deputy?\"\n\n\"Because if anyone were to know who they are, then they could be a target for assassination,\" he said irritably.\n\n\"But people are dying.\"\n\n\"Are you really so short sighted? Can you not see the forest through the trees,\" he asked. His voice rose. \"People are doing what they can. Maybe they aren't able to act as quickly as you'd like, but it seems to me that when trying to avoid assassination, the best way to go about an operation is in secret.\n\nYes, people are dying, but one can't help others when they, themselves, are dead, can they? Coming out too soon could cause more unnecessary deaths, and deterioration of any secret weapons or plans. That is why it is necessary for rebellious groups to remain anonymous. Groups like the contention only come about when an opposing force is too strong to fight head on; that's the situation that we're in right now, whether you realize it or not!\"\n\nLin didn't mean to upset him, but she had to ask. \"So you do believe in the Blackthorn Contention?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, I believe it. Who do you think has fought the Wackens off every time they've tried to take Blackthorn? Why do you think we still exist, here?\"\n\nLin didn't respond.\n\nThe meal became uncomfortable after that. Milton shut down and barely said two words to her. She understood him wanting to defend his town folk, but she didn't understand why asking questions upset him.\n\nWhen the meal ended, Milton looked almost relieved. He walked her up to the steps of her apartment building.\n\n\"I'm afraid this is where I must leave you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lin without much surprise that he didn't want to come up upstairs. \"See ya.\"\n\nShe turned her back to him and stuck her key in the lock. The last thing she wanted was a kiss or a hug from from him.\n\nAs the lock clicked and she reached for the door knob, the bushes that lined both sides of the door rustled. The first thought that came to mind was the figure from the restaurant.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said and spun around, but Milton had gone.\n\nTypically, witches and wizards couldn't disappear so silently, so she called out loud, \"Milton?\"\n\nNo one responded.\n\n\"AAhh!\" she screamed as something jumped out at her.\n\nA stinky man in a wrinkled suit stood out of the bushes.\n<end of reference>\nExtract from the text any information about the group \"Blackthorn Contention\".

His abs weren't as prominent, but I could see the six-pack outlines faintly.\n\nThen I noticed his broad shoulders, they had red nail marks all over the skin. \"Bullet!\" I closed the gap between us and hovered my fingers over his shoulder, not wanting to touch it. \"Did I-\"\n\n\"Don't worry.\" His hand enclosed on mine and pulled it to his chest. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nI looked up at him, and he was tired, I could tell with his hooded eyes, but it had an understanding that flicked in the dim light.\n\n\"I should have warned you, I'm sorry.\" I took my free hand and placed it over a couple of the scratches that were on his shoulder. He didn't flinch.\n\n\"Want some tea?\" he whispered.\n\nI guess he heard our conversation. \"I'll make it; you go treat those scratches.\" I noticed our close proximity, his hand holding mine and mine on his shoulder. I slipped them away slowly so I wouldn't offend him and took a step back.\n\nHe watched me carefully, looking like I would explode again.\n\n\"I'm okay now.\" I nodded. He walked by me, our shoulders touching as he went upstairs, still watching me until he was gone.\n\nI didn't go back to sleep, I just sat on the couch with my mug--a white one with a rooster on it--and pretended to watch the TV. Bullet didn't ask questions and refused to go upstairs. He sat in his loveseat that reclined and fell asleep pretty quickly. Luckily, it was Saturday, and we didn't have to go to work the next day.\n\nI made a trip back up to his room and fixed the mess I had made. I even swept up the broken lamp and made a mental note to buy him a new one. I fixed the sheets and made the bed, arranging the room back to its perfect style.\n\nI found a duffle with a few of my clothes and bathroom products. It was seven in the morning so I went ahead and changed into a black cotton t-shirt, jeans, and brushed my teeth. The bag even had my brush, so I brushed out my unruly hair from the night before.\n\nI went downstairs and Bullet was still asleep. I grabbed a brown blanket that was in a linen closet in the hall, but before I folded it over him, I really looked at him. His mouth was slightly open and deep breaths were coming out. His sharp features seemed so soft when he was asleep.\n\nHe couldn't be dangerous. Not to me. Not after what he did. Not after he witnessed my freak out and did all he could. It was like he knew me. In tune with me? How?\n\nI looked at the red scratch marks on his shoulders. They seemed to have healed well, and were just faint red lines, so I didn't dig into him that bad. Dem used to get them much worse when I first started, but he knew to let it ride out until I woke up after a while.\n\nMy eyes hovered to the little trail going down his abs, but then something dark caught my eye. I kneeled down next to him and tried to take a closer look without waking or touching him. Mmm... I took a small inhale... He smelled like a deep forest or something else very earthy.\n\nOn both his sides, he had...scars? They were round, indented a little, and a little more pigmented from his already golden skin. There were two about five inches apart. Then there were three on his other side. I skimmed his skin more closely and he had two more on his left shoulder. What were they? Burn marks? Wounds?\n\nI grabbed my right shoulder on instinct. I hated looking at mine in the mirror. Another reminder of her, and even worse... a permanent one. It wasn't too big, about a two to three-inch line, and it had a slight pink tone to my tan skin. It wasn't deep when she stabbed me, so it wasn't too raised, luckily. You could only see it if you were looking for it. At least, that's what I told myself.\n\nBut his scars? They were unique, and I'd never seen one like them before, let alone in multiple places.\n\nI heard him take a deep breath, but he didn't wake up.

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abRead this for context:\nLocal governments levy property taxes on property owners within their locality. Governments use taxes to provide taxpayers with various services, including schools, police, fire and garbage collection. Property taxes are calculated by applying an assessment ratio to the property\u2019s fair market value.\n\nState, county and local governments rely on tax funds to pay for services like schools, road maintenance and police and fire, among many other services. Depending on where you live, you may receive tax bills from the county, city and school district, but most areas provide one super-bill for you to pay.\n\nEvery homeowner pays taxes based on their home\u2019s value and the property tax rates for the county or city. Most areas charge property taxes semiannually, and you pay them in arrears. For example, in 2021, you\u2019d pay the property taxes for 2020.\n\nProperty taxes and real estate taxes are interchangeable terms. The IRS calls property taxes real estate taxes, but they are the same in all aspects. The money collected helps the government fund services for the community.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll also see a special assessment tax. This occurs when your locality needs to raise money to fund a specific project.\n\nThe real estate calculation process is complex and varies by the state or county you live in. It\u2019s always best to consult your state and county websites to learn the laws in your area and how taxes are assessed.\n\nTo find your property\u2019s assessed value, the local government will order an appraisal on the property. Some areas conduct annual appraisals. Others do them every 3 years or less frequently (it varies by area).\n\nSome localities use the market value (how much the home would sell for in the open market) and others use the appraised value (the value the appraiser determined for the home). Either way, they take a percentage of this value to come up with the assessed value.\n\nThe percentage they use is called the assessment ratio or the percentage of the home\u2019s value that\u2019s taxable. The ratios vary drastically around the country.\n\nFor example, if your home\u2019s market value is $300,000 and your local government taxes 60% of the value, you\u2019d pay taxes on $180,000 rather than $300,000.\n\nMost areas offer property tax exemptions to certain demographics. The exemptions are an attempt to make it easier for homeowners to afford their property taxes. In some cases, it may even eliminate property taxes altogether.\n\nHere are the most common property tax exemptions, but check with your local government to see what options you have.\n\nHomestead Exemption\nMost areas offer a homestead exemption or a discount for living in the property full-time. You won\u2019t qualify for this exemption if you use the home as a vacation or investment home.\n\nSenior Citizen Exemption\nMany areas offer a senior citizen exemption which either discounts real estate taxes or freezes them at a specific rate. To qualify, you usually have to be of a particular age and live in the property full-time. This can be especially helpful if you\u2019re on a fixed income.\n\nReligious Exemptions\nIf your property is a church, religious or charitable institution, it may be exempt from real estate taxes.\n\nExemptions for Homeowners with Disabilities\nIf you\u2019re a disabled homeowner (veteran or not), you may be eligible for an exemption that either reduces your tax liability or eliminates it. Every government has different rules and different exemptions based on the severity of your disability.\n\nEvery county has different rules when collecting tax payments. Some localities collect them annually, while others require payments quarterly or annually.\n\nIf you\u2019re allowed and choose to pay your taxes yourself, you will pay them in full when they become due. Like we said earlier, some areas allow you to make quarterly or semi-annual payments to decrease the amount you\u2019ll pay at once.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ll make the total required payment by the due date or risk paying penalties and facing a tax lien.\n\nYour task is to:\nExplain all the information above from the point of view of a person who's hearing this for the first time, making it sound like a friendly conversation.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abSure thing!

Perhaps he inspires you because he poses a threat to the social order. Perhaps he\u2019s bigger than the social order. He\u2019s certainly less na\u00efve about the supposed good guys, and a lot more candid about going after what he wants: the mother lode.\n\nIn Safe House, Washington plays Tobin Frost, a CIA agent who reportedly wrote the book on modern interrogations before becoming the company\u2019s most notorious traitor. Wanted on four continents, he has no allegiances and no relationships outside work. Is there anything he loves? Yes: \u201972 Petrus. With his favorite wines, he permits himself to sniff, sip, and, for a moment, get intimate. Then back to business.\n\nAs the movie opens, Frost is in South Africa selling especially incendiary intelligence when he\u2019s set upon by unknown assassins, who are prodigious enough to compel him to take refuge at the nearby American consulate, where he knows, at least, he won\u2019t be killed. Promptly arrested, he\u2019s transported to a Cape Town safe house managed by junior agent (and \u201chousesitter\u201d) Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who\u2019s frustrated by his lack of opportunities for advancement. He\u2019s about to get one. When the safe house is breached and everyone else wiped out, he finds himself on the lam with a handcuffed Frost.\n\nBy the middle of Safe House, I\u2019d predicted every cross and double-cross to come but was goggle-eyed anyway. Director Daniel Espinosa is (despite that Spanish surname) a Swede who has obviously studied state-of-the-art Euro thrillers by Luc Besson and above all the Bourne pictures. He packs the film with jump-cuts and fist-fights in which the careening, handheld camera goes tight on the blows and counter-blows and glass- and furniture-smashing, with Reynolds getting blasted around the frame like a pinball. The movie is color-coordinated \u2014 fluorescent greens and blues and purples \u2014 down to the glossy, tutti-frutti storage units in a Cape Town stadium complex. In one rollicking car chase, Weston evades assorted bullet-spitting baddie vans while grappling with his passenger, who puts him in a choke hold that sends their car swerving all over the highway.\n\nSafe House isn\u2019t all crashed cars and dodged bullets: The quieter scenes have their own punch. (The script is by David Guggenheim.) Frost the infamous turncoat preys on the insecurities of Weston the company man, planting doubts about his superiors (they include Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Shepard) and even his potential for a lasting relationship with his dishy French doctor girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder). What separates Safe House from the standard Cuisinart-cut action picture is that it\u2019s marinated in post-Iraq cynicism, that the bad guy\u2019s way of seeing the world is closer to how the world is than anyone giving the hero his orders. No, that doesn\u2019t let Washington\u2019s Frost off the hook: The film\u2019s morality is too Hollywood-conventional for that. But in the end, he\u2019s the only one of Weston\u2019s mentors who matters. The title has a nice irony: The safe house is the least safe place on Earth.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nPlease rewrite the article about the movie Safe House in the form of a poem. It should have 3-5 stanzas. Be sure to include the actors involved, the plot, and the reason the movie is called Safe House.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abDenzel Washington plays a CIA agent\nwho knows how to get things done.\nRyan Reynolds plays his protege,\nan agent who's not yet the master.\n\nThe movie is full of action and intrigue,\nwith lots of chases and gunfights.\nIt's a thrilling ride from start to finish,\nwith lots of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.\n\nThe movie is called Safe House because\nit's about a safe house that's not so safe.\nIt's a metaphor for the movie itself,\na thrilling ride that's not for the faint of heart.\n\nSo if you're looking for a movie that's exciting and fun,\nwith lots of action and suspense,\ncheck out Safe House,\nit's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\u00bb\u00bb",

Even with that being the case, he had other suitors and is a well-respected offensive mind. He was also a huge fan of Kyler Murray. Arizona ended up taking Murray first overall this season, which was expected considering Kingbury's fondness for the Heisman Trophy winner. What wasn't expected was the way they danced around the subject and left Josh Rosen hanging all year long \u2014 and even claimed he was their guy at times. Rosen was finally sent to the Miami Dolphins, where he will try and get his career rolling. As weird as it all was when going down, the Cards did end up landing a pretty impressive draft haul, especially on offense. Murray will have Hakeem Butler, Andy Isabella and KeeSean Johnson joining him. Those players, as well as Christian Kirk's presence, make the future look bright in the desert, as long as they can keep Murray from being beaten up. That's why they go for an offensive lineman here in Andrew Thomas.

You can remind yourself that you embraced this new journey because the well-traveled road you had been on was not fulfilling anymore. You know there is more. The best way to rejuvenate is to create. An act of creation brings you energy and excitement, and you are no longer tired.\n\n\\---\n\nThe Release of Light\n\nAs you transform, your light is free to go out in the world. How can your light have been free before this within the many constraints of upbringing, conditioning and experience? In the breaking down, you release from these things. It is a creative destruction, of sorts. As the old breaks down, new imaginal cells form. These cells hold your light and know no constraint.\n\n\\---\n\nHow Does a Star Transform?\n\n(A very layperson's explanation)\n\nA star is formed in a huge cloud of dust and gas and immediately begins to contract. Then, by the force of its own gravity, it begins to stabilize and take shape. In its life cycle, there are many variations of fusion, release of energy and transformation. Stars die as they begin to collapse on themselves.\n\nAs in nature's Chrysalis, there is pressure, expansion, destruction, birth, death, and change in the life cycle of a star. There are so many clues and guides in nature for our own transformation. Can you think of other processes in nature that can inform your own transformation?\n\n\\---\n\nPivotal Points\n\nIn each transformation, there are pivotal points where you must proceed or risk not making it through the process. These points are not clearly defined. However, you may sense them as they appear. They are decision points. At these decision points, you have a choice. You can find explanations and self-justifications for not proceeding. In the extreme, you can fall asleep\u2014turning back to your comfort zone and staying there. You can give in to fear. Or, you can acknowledge you are at a pivotal point and proceed.\n\nChrysalis takes place outside of your comfort zone. That is the place where true change can occur. Each time you grow, you leave your comfort zone and enter a new zone. There's adventure and excitement in that.\n\nStay aware for these pivotal points.\n\n\\---\n\nTry this:\n\nThink of a time in your life when you were scared, but you kept going.\n\nWhat gave you the strength and courage to proceed? (You can use that again.)\n\nWhat would have happened if you did not proceed?\n\nHow would your life be now?\n\n\\---\n\nThe Futility of Resistance\n\nThe caterpillar does not have a choice whether to enter Chrysalis or not. It is a process of nature. You have choice. You can never start, or you can resist progressing. Even though you have choice, resistance is futile. By resisting, you lose.\n\nHow do you lose? Humans are meant to grow and expand. If you resist transformation, either consciously or unconsciously, you regress. As you regress, you begin to go backwards. Growth is natural, and you are stopping that flow. You must deaden parts of yourself in order to block what is calling you.\n\nResistance does come easily during any kind of change. Underneath resistance is fear. The key is to recognize fear and learn how to break its grip. You may not even know that you are resisting. The small mind is very good at disguising fear as logic or subsuming it so deeply that you do not know it is there.\n\nIf resistance is futile, do you just push on? Yes and no. Part of the journey is learning how to recognize your resistance and overcome it. You grow in the process. Also, as humans, resistance is part of us. You are here to learn. By facing your resistance, you will see its futility and leave it behind.\n\n\\---\n\nResistance Can Harm You\n\nAs change beckons you,\n\nResisting may succeed\n\nIn slowing you down\n\nFor awhile.\n\nInstruction:\nWrite a bulleted summary of the key points of transformation from this text in at least 5 bullet points for a layperson audience.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abRelease of Light: As you transform, your light is free to go out in the world.\n\nCreative Destruction: In the breaking down, you release from these things. It is a creative destruction, of sorts.\n\nDecision Points: In each transformation, there are pivotal points where you must proceed or risk not making it through the process.\n\nChrysalis: Each time you grow, you leave your comfort zone and enter a new zone.\n\nResistance is Futile: The caterpillar does not have a choice whether to enter Chrysalis or not.\u00bb\u00bb",

They are large, powerful animals that can be found in a variety of habitats across the world. Boars have a distinctive appearance, with long, curved tusks, thick hides, and a muscular body. They are highly intelligent and have a complex social structure, living in groups called sounders that can include several individuals.\n\nIn the wild, boars are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet consists of a variety of foods, including nuts, fruits, roots, and insects. They are adept diggers and can quickly excavate a large area of soil in search of food. Boars are also known for their aggressive behavior, particularly when protecting their young or their territory.\n\nWild boars have been hunted for their meat and tusks for centuries, and they continue to be a popular target for hunters today. In some cultures, boars are also revered as symbols of strength and resilience, with their ability to thrive in a variety of environments and their willingness to defend themselves against predators.\n\nHowever, wild boars also pose a threat to human communities, as they can cause damage to crops and infrastructure. In some areas, they are considered pests and are actively managed or controlled by conservationists and farmers.\n\nOverall, the wild boar is a fascinating creature with a rich history and a complex relationship with humans.

Previously, he had served as Adjunct Secretary of the Apostolic Signatura, since Saturday, 24 August 2013. Previously, he had been serving as the Secretary General of the Governatorate of Vatican City State since his appointment by Benedict XVI on 3 September 2011.\n\nBiography\nSciacca was born in Catania, Italy.  After having completed his initial theological studies in Catania he was sent to Rome for further studies.  Sciacca is an alumnus of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum where he earned a degree in canon law.  He later obtained a degree in philosophy from the University of Catania. He was ordained on 7 October 1978, belonging to the clergy of the Diocese of Acireale, in addition to pastoral ministry carried out in the Collegiate Church of St. Sebastiano in Acireale, has taught Philosophy and History at the State High Schools and canon law at the Theological Institute of Acireale. \n\nAfter being appointed as defender of the Bond and Promoter of Justice in the Diocesan and Regional Tribunals of Sicily, has been appointed Judge at the same court in Palermo Regional Siculus. On 25 March 1999 he was appointed as a Prelate Auditor of the Tribunal of the Roman Rota. Sciacca is a well-known scholar of the history of the liturgy and of the figure of Pius XII. But he is also a popular Latin scholar.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, the remains of Cardinal Pompedda were reinterred in a specially constructed sarcophagus in the cathedral of Ozieri at the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament. The requiem mass was celebrated at 5 p.m., presided by Bishop Sergio Pintor of Ozieri. At the end of the mass, Mgr Sciacca, judge of the Roman Rota and a long time collaborator of Cardinal Pompedda, read a special message sent for the occasion by Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, S.D.B., secretary of State, in the name of Pope Benedict XVI. \n\nOn 3 September 2011 he was appointed Titular Bishop of Victoriana and at the same time Secretary-General of the Governatorate of Vatican City State. In this new role he will assist incoming president, Archbishop Giuseppe Bertello in charge of many of the City State\u2019s departments such as its police, observatory, museums, post office and tourist information service.\n\nOn 8 October 2011, Sciacca received episcopal consecration from Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, SDB along with Barth\u00e9lemy Adoukonou, secretary of the Pontifical Council for Culture. On 13 February 2013, two days after the Pope announced his intention to resign, Pope Benedict appointed Bishop Sciacca to the post of Auditor General of Apostolic Camera.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nPlease rewrite the text to be more emotional and relatable, while keeping most of the facts the same.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abGiuseppe Sciacca is an Italian-born man who has served the Vatican in many important roles, most recently as the Secretary of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. He was appointed to this position by Pope Francis on July 16, 2016, after previously serving as the Adjunct Secretary of the Apostolic Signatura and as the Secretary General of the Governatorate of Vatican City State.\n\nSciacca's journey to his current position has been a long and winding one. He was born in Catania, Italy, and after completing his initial theological studies in his hometown, he went on to further his education in Rome. He earned a degree in canon law from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum and later obtained a degree in philosophy from the University of Catania.\n\nSciacca's dedication to the Church and his work as a theologian and canon law scholar has been recognized by the Pope on several occasions. In 1999, he was appointed as a Prelate Auditor of the Tribunal of the Roman Rota, and in 2011, he was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Governatorate of Vatican City State.\n\nHowever, it was in 2016 that Sciacca's role within the Vatican truly came into focus. After the retirement of Archbishop Frans Daneels, Pope Francis appointed Sciacca as the new Secretary of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. This appointment was significant not only because it marked a new chapter in Sciacca's career, but also because it highlighted the Pope's commitment to promoting and preserving the importance of the Church's legal system.\n\nAs Secretary of the Supreme Tribunal\u00bb\u00bb",

The division, after a couple of previous flirtations with existence, was formally birthed by a then-fledgling IBF in 1984.  On March 28 of that year, journeyman Murray Sutherland captured a fifteen round decision over Ernie Singletary.\n\nIt was less than a nuclear arrival.\n\nSutherland would be stopped one fight later by Chong-Pal Park and Park would go on to a healthy run.  In 1988, the WBA crowned its first 168 lb. champion, a distinction which would also go to a Park who had vacated his IBF belt between tilts.  Park\u2019s lineage would hold up through the WBA reign of Bruno Girard but become obscured and insignificant as the division developed.\n\nThe WBC and WBO would join the fray in 1988 with initial titlists Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns and the division quickly began the climb to respect.  Often a panacea for European fighters, America\u2019s best have also played a strong role and while there has been many an ornery bastard over the years, it has hardly been the makings of a bastard class.

The best part about last night's dinner conversation was getting into a debate with Jonah over the primacy of the never talk to strangers rule when your townhouse catches fire and you don't know the neighbors.\n\n-o-\n\nJonah: Have you ever seen a walking flower?\n\nMe: No.\n\nJonah: You should have that dream.\n\n-o-\n\nI love that Jonah can't help but dance when he hears music, even if it's in the middle of karate class.\n\n-o-\n\n### **Chapter 4: Aaron 2** , Jonah 5\n\n-o-\n\nTonight Jonah asked me \"When are we having a real dinner?\" Sigh... I guess I need to start spending more time in the kitchen.\n\n-o-\n\nI'm actually kinda excited to be getting a Christmas gift from Jonah that I didn't have to pick out, buy, or wrap. Yay chintzy in-school holiday shopping... things!\n\n-o-\n\nWow... Some of Jonah's kindergarten classmates have been telling him he needs to get a new backpack because Handy Manny is for babies. Really? At kindergarten? Sigh.... Oddly enough, apparently nobody has said a word about his ladybug lunchbox.\n\n-o-\n\nAs y'all may recall Jonah did his own holiday shopping this year sans parents. Since my parents are heading back home to San Diego today he gave them their Christmas gifts early - identical \"World's Best Grandpa\" mugs.\n\n-o-\n\nAaron has developed a big love of Cookie Monster, so Kiren took him to the store to get one. Aaron spotted one, ran over, squeezed all his limbs, and, when that failed to provoke a response, Aaron declared him \"broken\" and lost interest.\n\n-o-\n\nHow we found out that baby Aaron did not like long car trips.\n\nWe have some family in Pittsburgh that we visit on a fairly regular basis. Often enough that we knew with some confidence that it was about a five and a half hour drive each way. Not too long after Aaron was born, we decided to make another trip out there. The first 45 minutes went okay. Possibly because he was asleep. That part I don't remember. I do remember that we had at least made it from New Jersey into Pennsylvania when Aaron's crying forced our first stop. So we stopped, changed him, fed him, held him a little while, then strapped him back into his car seat and continued with our journey. For about twenty minutes, which is when Aaron's screaming got us so scared that we actually pulled over to the shoulder of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to make sure that he wasn't literally choking on his tears. And since we were stopped anyway, we changed him, fed him, held him a little while, then strapped him back into his car seat, with Kiren wedging herself between Aaron's and Jonah's car seats before we continued on our journey. This bought us another 30 minutes. And so on.\n\nIt took us thirteen hours to reach our destination. Kiren flew back with Aaron and I drove the car back with Jonah. Who convinced me to stop at a McDonald's at 4am for him even though he wasn't hungry because, as he said, \"There might not be any place to stop when I do get hungry.\"\n\n-o-\n\nI could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure the kids were unsupervised for about twenty minutes today when Kiren and I succumbed to exhaustion in different parts of the house.\n\n-o-\n\nJonah's gingerbread house has Hershey's kiss cannons with which the good guys inside can shoot the bad guys outside.\n\n-o-\n\nI'm not sure what amused me most about this evening: a) Jonah put on a show tonight; b) to which he charged admission (25 cents); c) before the show began, he announced that videotaping and flash photography were not allowed during the performance; or d) the performance was an hour long.\n\n-o-\n\nSo... those of you who have seen my basement know I discourage entry for safety reasons. Jonah just headed downstairs with a digital camera and brought Kiren back a photo of a toy he needed help extracting from its strata.\n\n-o-\n\nI surrender. Jonah wins this battle.\n\"\"\"\nPlease rewrite the text to be more formal and informative, as though it were written by a parenting expert.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abDear Readers,\n\nI am writing to you today with an important message about parenting and the safety of your children. As a parent myself, I understand the importance of creating a safe and secure environment for our children.\n\nIt is important to teach our children the importance of never talking to strangers. This rule should be prioritized above all others in case of an emergency, such as a fire in your home. If your child is unable to escape the fire on their own, they should stay put and wait for help from a trusted adult, such as a parent or a neighbor they know.\n\nIt is also important to teach our children the importance of stranger danger. This includes teaching them to never accept gifts or rides from strangers, and to always stay within eyesight of a trusted adult.\n\nIt is important to teach our children about the dangers of talking to strangers, as this can help prevent them from becoming victims of crime or abduction. It is also important to teach our children about the importance of staying safe and secure in their own homes, as this can help prevent accidents and injuries.\n\nAs parents, it is our responsibility to teach our children about the importance of safety and security, and to provide them with a safe and secure environment in which to grow and thrive. I hope that this message has been helpful in raising awareness about the importance of parenting and the safety of our children.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this message, and I hope that you have found it helpful.\n\nSincerely,\n\nParenting Expert\u00bb\u00bb",

What is the difference between monks and nuns in Buddhist traditions?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abMonks play a significant role in Buddhist societies as spiritual leaders, teachers, and role models. They are expected to adhere to strict moral and ethical guidelines, including abstinence from sexual activity, intoxicants, and killing. In many Buddhist traditions, monks undergo a formal process of ordination and receive extensive training in the teachings and practices of the Buddhist path.\n\nThe day-to-day life of a monk varies depending on the specific tradition and country. Generally, monks follow a daily routine of meditation, prayer, and study. They may also engage in manual labor, such as cooking, cleaning, and maintaining the temple or monastery.\n\nIn contrast to monks, nuns in Buddhist traditions are not required to follow the same strict guidelines for behavior and morality. However, they still follow a daily routine of meditation, prayer, and study, and are expected to adhere to certain precepts and guidelines for behavior.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nWhile the relationship between Palestinian and Native American struggles against settler-colonialism should always have been obvious, the connection was rarely made until fairly recently.\n\nMainstream Western media was expectedly oblivious to or dismissive of both struggles to begin with, and Arab media, as US-Arab author and academician Steven Salaita explained, subscribed to the belief that Native Americans were already \u201cdefeated and disinherited\u201d.\n\nThis meant that when a comparison was ever made, the Native American narrative was perceived as a fast-forwarded version of the current Palestinian narrative.\n\nBased on the assumption \u2014 that of the permanent dispossession and defeat of the Natives \u2014 \u201cthose concerned with the colonization of Palestine can be tempted to evoke Natives as the victims of a tragic fate that Palestinians must avoid,\u201d Salaita wrote in the Electronic Intifada.\n\nYet this is simply not true. Native Americans, despite centuries of government-led genocide, denial or rights and breaking of numerous treaties, are yet to concede their right to exist and be recognized, displaying what has proved to be a noble, protracted fight.\n\nNeither did Palestinians. In fact, this very collective resistance to oppression is the most defining trait shared between both groups.\n\nWhile modern forms of communication technologies are yet to provide access to media platforms that are equitably available to all groups \u2014 especially those who are the most disaffected, poor classes \u2014 social media and other online platforms had revolutionized and globalized solidarity.\n\nNow that the New York Times, for example, has lost its monopoly on informing and editorializing, numerous alternatives, albeit smaller and not as well-funded, are free to fill the unexplored discourse, one that mattered little to the elite of traditional media.\n\nCurrently, no amount of mainstream media propaganda can possibly delink Palestinian rights from the history of apartheid in South Africa or the struggle of Native Americans.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that such a narrative \u2014 that of global solidarity between oppressed groups around the world \u2014 has not permeated global awareness to be a centre of a worldwide discussion until recently, it is worth noting, in fact celebrating, that the solidarity discourse is making serious headway.\n\nCompassions now abound between Palestinians and Native Americans. And it\u2019s about time.\n\nThis comparison imposed and manifested itself recently when thousands of Native Americans resurrected the fighting spirit of their forefathers as they stood in unprecedented unity to contest an oil company\u2019s desecration of their sacred land in North Dakota. Considering its burdened historical context, this has been one of the most moving events in recent memory.\n\nThe Dakota Nation is justifiably alarmed by the prospect that its water supplies will be polluted by the massive pipeline which, if completed will extend across four states and stretch over 1,100 miles.\n\nWhile the issue of water rights in that region may seem extraneous to most of us, it should in fact be a matter of urgency and relevance, considering inhumane neoliberal economic practices are metamorphosing, with the constant aim of placing profits before people everywhere in the world.\n\nUnderstanding the significance of the fight for the unity and future of Native American, hundreds of tribes have mobilised not only to protect the water of the Dakota Nation, but also to reassert their common fight for justice which has still not been settled after many years.\n\nExpectedly, the mobilisation of the tribes has been met with state violence. Rather than appreciating the serious grievances of the tribes, particularly those in the Standing Rock Reservation, the state governor summoned all law enforcement agencies and activated the National Guard. The standoff has been marred by state violence and many arrests, and is still ongoing.\n\nNevertheless, the current mobilisation of Native American tribes \u2014 and the massive solidarity they have garnered \u2014 is far greater than the struggle against a money-hungry corporation, backed by an aggressive state apparatus. It is about the spirit of the Native people of that land, who have suffered a prolonged genocide aimed at their complete eradication.\n\nInstruction:\nI am someone who is completely new to either the Native American or Palestinian crisis. How does the passage develop a sympathetic view for their related struggle, and how does the author build a narrative of unity for oppressed groups world wide? The response should be informative and at least 200 words.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe passage develops a sympathetic view for the Native American and Palestinian struggles by highlighting the shared history of oppression and resistance against colonialism. The author draws parallels between the two struggles, emphasizing the similarities in the methods used by colonial powers to subjugate and dispossess Indigenous peoples. The author also emphasizes the importance of global solidarity and the power of social media in spreading awareness of these struggles.\n\nThe author builds a narrative of unity for oppressed groups worldwide by highlighting the shared experiences of Indigenous peoples around the world, regardless of their geographical location or cultural background. The author also emphasizes the importance of standing in solidarity with other oppressed groups, such as the Dakota Nation and their fight for water rights.\n\nOverall, the passage serves as a call to action for people to recognize the interconnectedness of struggles for justice and equality around the world, and to work towards building a more just and equitable world for all.\u00bb\u00bb",

He's close in terms of space but he's not close in terms of what he can teach you or what he can tell you, so emotionally he's quite distant from you. At the moment, for example, in this auditorium many of you are emotionally distant from each other, even though you're sitting right next to each other. You are completely emotionally disconnected from each other. You can be in the same physical space but at the same time totally out of rapport with each other, not even understanding what your next door neighbour is thinking, feeling or expressing in any way. It's exactly the same for a spirit. A spirit can be sitting right next to you but be totally out of rapport with you because of the difference in their emotional condition and their condition in love compared to yours at that moment.\n\nParticipant: Ironically that would mean some intermediary spirit would carry the same wounds as you so he could communicate through that wound?\n\nCorrect. Often they do have wounds, but they're learning the process of how to release those wounds. However, often they have similar wounds and therefore there's a distortion of the higher spirit's communication through that wound.\n\n4.2. Inaccuracies during Angelo's channelling\n\nI can give one illustration of when Peter was channelling. When I started asking questions about where his soulmate was and the condition that Angelo himself is in, Peter's emotions started kicking in. That's when we started getting inaccurate information. Angelo is not in the fifteenth dimension, but this is something that Peter would like to believe is true. And his soulmate does not necessarily have the injury that Peter described. Those particular things come from some of Peter's feelings, and Peter's feelings about the world, and Peter's lady's feelings.\n\nParticipant: So in this case Angelo didn't lie, it just didn't come through because of the emotion?\n\nAngelo is still telling the truth, or attempting to, but Peter cannot accurately hear it while that emotional injury exists. Do not assume that the spirit is the person at fault. We must always assume that it's our own condition that is causing the inaccuracy in communication, always. The spirit, even a spirit in a first sphere condition, is very rarely at fault in their communication with regard to what they believe to be true, but often what they believe doesn't get accurately reflected.\n\nThis is why many of you can visit a medium and they'll say, \"This spirit says he's in the seventh dimension, he's this and that, this and that,\" but he's really in the hells of the first dimension. However we often believe he's in the seventh, and sometimes the person who's doing the mediumship believes it. The spirit may not believe he's in the seventh but sometimes the person doing the mediumship would like to believe he's in the seventh and that's why the spirit, the person, says all of those things. [01:17:40.27]\n\nMary: I feel that it requires a lot of humility on the part of the medium to be able to be open enough emotionally to feel the emotions of the spirits involved, because the minute that we can do that we very often get feedback that says, \"What he says, that's wrong,\" or \"I have to step back now.\n<end of reference>\nWhat are some common emotional injuries that can distort communication between spirits?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abOne common emotional injury that can distort communication between spirits is the inability to release wounds. Spirits often have similar wounds, and when they communicate through those wounds, the communication can be distorted. Another emotional injury that can distort communication is a difference in emotional condition between the spirit and the person they are communicating with.\u00bb\u00bb",

She helped me. But it's as overwhelming as this.\"\n\nShe nodded. She was feeling completely overwhelmed.\n\nAnd she wanted to know for certain that she could go back to the planet's surface when she wanted. She was trusting Fisher more and more, but now she needed that final feeling that she wasn't trapped before she could relax a little.\n\n\"How about we go meet your friend Doc, then go get our transport devices and head back to the lodge. You can give me the basics there.\"\n\n\"Sounds perfect,\" Fisher said, smiling.\n\nOn the way out, he showed her how to get into The Lady if she needed to, which she thought was an amazing amount of trust.\n\nA few moments later they were standing in the engineering section of the big ship again.\n\nThis time Doc and a woman were alone, so Fisher led her toward him. As they got close, this very skinny man glanced up and broke into a huge smile that seemed to completely fill his face and almost made his nose vanish.\n\nThe woman beside him, also tall and very skinny did the same.

The disconnect between what delivery drivers expect and what customers are tipping has led to confrontations: DoorDash fired one of its drivers after he cursed at a woman for tipping $5 on a $20 order. \n\nAt the time, DoorDash said that it's OK for a driver to \u201crespectfully\u201d ask for a tip \u2014 but that abusing a customer isn't OK. \u201cOur rules exist to help ensure everyone who uses our platform \u2014 Dashers, customers, merchants \u2014 have a safe and enjoyable experience,\u201d a spokesperson previously told Insider.\n\nBut what's \u201cenjoyable\u201d for a customer could be at odds with what's enjoyable for a driver. So we set out to ask 10 delivery people across New York City: What do they think is a reasonable tip?\n\nWe used DoorDash to order a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee from Starbucks. The total came to $14.65 with tax and service fees. We tipped $2.50 \u2014 or 17% \u2014 then asked the driver what he thought. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, because it was a \u201csmall order.\u201d He said people should tip based on the size of the order. In other words, if you're ordering dinner for 10 \u2014 with all those accompanying boxes and bags \u2014 then you should tip more, he said. \n\nFor context, this Starbucks was about 400 feet from our office in downtown Manhattan \u2014 or a two-minute walk, according to Google Maps.\n\nWe placed a second Starbucks order for an egg wrap and an iced matcha drink. The total came to $17.43. We added a $2.50 tip \u2014 a little more than 14%. This time, the driver was disappointed. He said he would have liked to have seen a $5 or even $6 tip. That'd be 30% to 34% of the total.\n\nFor their part, DoorDash, UberEats, and Grubhub didn't respond to requests for comment on what customers should tip. In a blog post from 2019, Grubhub suggested customers tip 20% \u2014 and consider adding more if it's an extra-big order, or if there's bad weather.\n\nThe working world looks different from it did 3 years ago. These tips can help your employees operate effectively in the \u2018virtual office.\u2019\n\nAlberto Mendes, a driver who's been delivering for Grubhub and DoorDash for the past seven years, told Insider: \u201cWhen you order delivery, it's a commodity. You're not going out, it comes to you. I'm the one that goes through 90-degree weather, going up and down a walk-up, signing in to a building \u2014 all of that is time for me.\u201d\n\nThe general consensus among the 10 delivery workers Insider talked to was that a reasonable tip falls somewhere between 15% to 20% of the total bill \u2014 and that percentage should be calculated on the grand total that includes taxes and fees, they contended.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how big your order is \u2014 good tips are at least 15%,\u201d said a DoorDasher who declined to share his name. \n\nThat means the woman who tipped $5 on her $20 DoorDash order \u2014 which is a 25% gratuity \u2014 actually gave quite a good tip, drivers said.\n\n\u201cA $5 tip on a $20 order? That's not bad at all. I mean nowadays, a $5 tip is good,\u201d said Olam, a delivery worker for both Instacart and Grubhub who didn't want to give his last name.\n\nStill, the \u201cvibecession\u201d that's set in across the country \u2014 exacerbated by rising prices and concerns about a looming recession \u2014 means customers are ordering \u2014 and thereby tipping \u2014 less than they were in the freewheeling days of the pandemic. As a result, delivery drivers said they've shifted their expectations around what constitutes a good tip. \n\n\u201cIn Covid-19, you might get $10 on the same order\u201d for which a customer might tip $5 today, Olam said. \n\nThe biggest tips he's gotten recently? \u201cI would say $20, on a $60 or $70 order,\u201d Mendes said, chuckling. That's around 28% to 33%. \u201cBut before, I used to get $80 on a $60 order,\u201d he said, recalling a 133% tip from during the height of the pandemic. \u201cYou have to understand Covid-19 was a different story because you were risking your life pretty much,\u201d he said.\n\nThese days, it's the meager tips that stick in the mind of some delivery workers: One Grubhub driver who declined to give his name said he got a $5 tip on a $1,000 delivery a few months ago. \u201cIt was so heavy,\u201d he said of all the bags.\n\nStill, even that beats receiving nothing.\n\n\u201cSometimes it can be a $100 order, and you'll get zero,\u201d said Juan, a delivery worker who didn't want to give his last name who said he's been working with Grubhub for seven years. \u201cEvery 10 orders, two will give you nothing.\u201d\n\nYour task is to:\nRewrite the text as an information leaflet that will be passed out to customers of food delivery services. Provide a section specifically on appropriate percentages for tipping and the importance of tipping. The section should consist of a bulletin list with at least 5 points.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abWe have created an information leaflet for customers of food delivery services. We have included information on the importance of tipping and what is a reasonable tip.\n\nIt has come to our attention that there is a lot of confusion around tipping etiquette. As such, we want to provide our customers with information on how much to tip.\n\nWe understand that not everyone is aware of the correct amount to tip, and we want to help our customers make informed decisions.\n\nThe following are some guidelines on what is a reasonable tip and what percentage of the total bill to use:\n\n- A good tip is at least 15% of the total bill, including taxes and fees.\n- For small orders, a $2.50 tip is acceptable.\n- For larger orders, a 30% tip is recommended.\n- If the service was exceptional, a tip of 20% or more is appreciated.\n- If the service was poor, a tip of 10% or less is appropriate.\n\nWe hope this information is helpful and will lead to a better experience for our customers and our delivery drivers.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abThe following information may be useful:\n<start of reference>\nMost vaccines should be given via the intramuscular route into the deltoid or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. This optimises the immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimises adverse reactions at the injection site. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of administering vaccines correctly. Clinical practice needs to reflect considerations about the right length and gauge of needles used to ensure that those vaccinated get the immunological benefit of the vaccines without local side effects.\n\nInjecting a vaccine into the layer of subcutaneous fat, where poor vascularity may result in slow mobilisation and processing of antigen, is a cause of vaccine failure\u2014for example in hepatitis B, rabies, and influenza vaccines. Compared with intramuscular administration, subcutaneous injection of hepatitis B vaccine leads to significantly lower seroconversion rates and more rapid decay of antibody response.\n\nTraditionally the buttocks were thought to be an appropriate site for vaccination, but the layers of fat do not contain the appropriate cells that are necessary to initiate the immune response (phagocytic or antigen-presenting cells). The antigen may also take longer to reach the circulation after being deposited in fat, leading to a delay in processing by macrophages and eventually presentation to the T and B cells that are involved in the immune response. In addition, antigens may be denatured by enzymes if they remain in fat for hours or days. The importance of these factors is supported by the findings that thicker skinfolds are associated with a lowered antibody response to vaccines.\n\nSerious reactions to intramuscular injections are rare; in one series of 26\u2009294 adults, of whom 46% had received at least one intramuscular injection, only 48 (0.4%) had a local adverse effect. However, subcutaneous injections can cause abscesses and granulomas. Muscle is probably spared the harmful effects of substances injected into it because of its abundant blood supply. Adipose tissue, having much poorer drainage channels, retains injected material for much longer and is therefore also more susceptible to its adverse effects. In the case of vaccines in which the antigen is adsorbed to an aluminium salt adjuvant\u2014such as those for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines\u2014the intramuscular route is strongly preferred because superficial administration leads to an increased incidence of local reactions such as irritation, inflammation, granuloma formation, and necrosis.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nBased on the reference, where would one be vaccinated according to the traditional thoughts? Injecting a vaccine on what substance would slow its effect?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe buttocks were thought to be an appropriate site for vaccination, but the subcutaneous fat would not contain the appropriate cells to initiate the immune response. This could lead to a delay in processing by macrophages and eventually presentation to the T and B cells that are involved in the immune response.

By 1945, this association was renamed to the current, The Motion Picture Association of America. Although the censorship laws have changed a bit over the years, they basically have the same system for rating motion pictures. Groups who wanted to protect their children from mature content in movies established the rating system for movies in 1968. Originally there were four ratings for movies, but now there are five, which include: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. Each rating is determined by the amount of adult content in the movie. The G rating on a movie stands for General Audience, which means the movie contains no nudity, sexual content, strong language or drug usage. Although there is still violence in G rated movies, it is minimal. A PG rated movie stands for Parental Guidance is suggested. Some content in a PG movie may not be suitable for children. PG-13 is a rating that strongly cautions parents about the adult content of this film. This rating was added in 1984 to show that the film had enough language, violence or sexual content for some parents to find inappropriate. The R rating on this system stands for restricted, meaning that no one under the age of 17 without a parent or guardian is permitted to watch that movie. The last on the system is NC-17, which means that no one under the age of 17 is permitted to watch the movie, because of the intense adult content the movie has.\n\nThe next board is the FCC, the board who has become infamous for censoring music on the radio. Censoring music isn't all the FCC does, according to the official FCC website, \"The FCC is barred by law from trying to prevent the broadcast of any point of view. The Communications Act prohibits the FCC from censoring broadcast material, in most cases, and from making any regulation that would interfere with freedom of speech. Expressions of views that do not involve a \"clear and present danger of serious substantive evil\" come under the protection of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\" The FCC censors any type of media sent out through the airwaves, whether it be television stations, radio waves, or anything put on a compact disc. The FCC has been trying to censor one of my favorite television shows, South Park, for almost 15 years now, until in 2001, they allowed the television show to push the envelope and say the word \"shit\" over one hundred and sixty times in a single episode. Since then, many other shows have slowly been putting more and more controversial content in their television shows and radio stations.\n\nThe last board is the ESRB. The ESRB is in charge of rating video games and mobile apps based on adult content. Unlike movies, games are released to the public before they are tested by the ESRB. How are the video games processed? Game companies, after completing a game will fill out a long questionnaire about the game it's content, bonus materials, language, controlled substances and sexual content featured within the game. After the questionnaire is complete, the companies must send in a DVD with pertinent content on it, including game play, missions\/quests, and cut scenes, along with the most extreme instances of any relevant content. According to the ESRB official website, \"All games rated in this manner are tested by ESRB shortly after they become publicly available to ensure that appropriate ratings have been assigned. In the event content was not fully or accurately disclosed by the publisher, either the rating displayed in the store will be promptly corrected or, in egregious cases, the game may be removed from the store.\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the text, extract the current rating systems used for movies, music and video games.

Who doesn\u2019t love a book club with their best friend? So many books focus on family life, historical events, romance, and *cough* men. But the coming-of-age memoir is getting a makeover. Each of the following books centers on a long-term, life-defining friendship. Spanning the 1950s to the \u201870s to the 21st century, these books are chaotic, inspiring, and heart-wrenching meditations on platonic love and intimacy, in particular platonic love and intimacy between women. These books are bound \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 to inspire conversation and appreciation between you and your forever friends for hours on end. \n\nMy Brilliant Friend, by Elena Ferrante\nUgh, this book broke my heart and taped it back together, and broke it again. It\u2019s the first of Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan Novels, a four-book story detailing the parallel lives of childhood best friends, Elena and Lila, as they come of age in Naples, Italy in the 1950s. The writing is beautiful, but what\u2019s special about the book is its unwavering attention to female friendship. The most formative relationship in these girls\u2019 lives is the one they share. While both girls are gifted students, only Elena has the resources and familial support to complete a formal education. This divergence splits the two apart, opening a new world to one girl and building a wall in front of the other. When I finished reading it, I immediately wanted to call all of my friends and tell them how much I love them.\n\nYou Made A Fool Of Death With Your Beauty, by Akwaeke Emezi You Made A Fool Of Death With Your Beauty is a deliciously fun romance novel, in which a young, widowed artist (Feyi) jets off to the Caribbean with a man she just met, only to find herself attracted to his father instead. Throughout the book, Feyi leans on her lover-turned-best-friend-turned-roommate (Joy) for tough love and advice. The two galavant around NYC at the story\u2019s outset. Joy appears throughout the book in FaceTime and phone calls, an unwavering source of love and comedic relief. The romance is steamy, but wouldn\u2019t feel nearly as fun without Joy\u2019s commentary along the way. It\u2019s a romance tailor-made for sunny summer days and discussion over brunch with your most chaotic partner-in-crime.\n\nConversations With Friends OR Beautiful World Where Are You, by Sally Rooney I couldn\u2019t pick just one! While Rooney\u2019s best-known work is the romance-inflected Normal People, her first and third novels put female friendship front and center. Conversations With Friends is a comedy of errors in which two college girlfriends turned best friends (Frances and Bobbi) and aspiring writers get wrapped up in the strained marriage of an older artist and her husband. Beautiful World Where Are You has a similar structure. A successful but reclusive writer (Alice) and her best friend (Eileen), a broke editor, correspond via long, rambling emails about aesthetics and politics, and the woes of 21st-century life. In both books, the pairs of friends pursue independent romantic relationships, but they\u2019re of lesser importance, and consequence, to the friendships they share. Be warned: these books WILL make you want to email your closest friends. \n\nJust Kids, by Patti Smith\nThis is my favorite book of all time. In Just Kids, godmother of punk music Patti Smith writes the story of her young life alongside the late, famed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. They met as starving artists in 1960s New York City, a relationship that evolved from a romantic entanglement to a deep, platonic intimacy that defined the rest of their lives. Before Mapplethorpe passed away, Smith promised to write the story of their life together. Never before have I witnessed a friendship so intimate that one person could write the memoir of the other. They were attuned to one another in an otherworldly way \u2014 life partners in nearly every sense of the word. It\u2019ll make you appreciate the friends in your life and aspire to see and be seen by them with the reverence that Smith and Mapplethorpe shared. \n\nTopics of Conversation, by Miranda Popkey\nThis is one for the chatty, the artistic, and the (lightly) philosophical \u2014 for your informal self-proclaimed social anthropologist friend with whom you ruminate on the intricacies of sex, romance, society, power, gender, and aging into the wee hours of the night. (Any Fleabag fans here?) The book uses interactions between women to tell the life story of an unnamed narrator who seeks intellectual artistic stimulation in her younger years only to be reshaped by the gendered expectations of her later life. The narrator is lonely, but her choices and experiences are endlessly thought-provoking. It\u2019s one of those books (I say from experience) where if you read it side-by-side with a friend, you\u2019ll have no choice but to take breaks and talk each section out.\n###\nPlease scan the text and extract the titles of the books about friendship and their respective authors mentioned in the passages.

With over 450 staff across six regions of the country, IOM has been providing life-saving humanitarian services to crisis-affected populations, promoting durable solutions to displacement for IDPs and returnees, and supporting community stabilization and early recovery activities, while steadily supporting programmes related to long-term recovery and migration governance and development.\n\nThe recently launched Mission Strategy 2019 \u2013 2021 is a testament to IOM's commitment to working closely and strengthening its partnership with the Government of Somalia in line with the country's National Development Plan.\n\nMinister Hassan highlighted the need for a closer cooperation between IOM and the Government and thanked the organization for its commitment to supporting Somalia and its people. \"The renewal of the cooperation agreement signifies the milestone thus far and reaffirms IOM's commitment to work jointly on migration related issues,\" Minister Hassan stated.\n\nFor his part, Abdiker highlighted the significant gains the Government and the people of Somalia have achieved over the past decade. He stressed the readiness of IOM to support the Government in achieving its development goals, including its commitments to SDGs and the Global Compact for Migration.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nWhat is the significance of this agreement in terms of IOM's support of development goals and migration-related issues in Somalia?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe agreement signed between IOM and the Federal Government of Somalia underlines their mutual interest in strengthening cooperation and working together on migration issues to promote economic and social development.

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abRead this for context:\n<start of reference>\nThe American Line was a shipping company founded in 1871 and based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It began as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, although the railroad got out of the shipping business soon after founding the company. In 1902, it became part of the International Navigation Co., with the American Line generally handling traffic between the United States ports of Philadelphia and New York City and the British ports of Liverpool and Southampton. Sister company Red Star Line handled traffic between America and the European continent, primarily through Antwerp, Belgium. The company's most prominent president was Clement Griscom, who led the company from 1888 to 1902 and worked as a company executive for its entire existence. During its existence, the company was the largest American shipping company, rivalled only by the smaller, Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines, although this distinction is a marginal one, as all American oceanic shipping concerns were dwarfed by British companies such as the  White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG.\n\nThe company became much larger when it bought out the Inman Line in 1886. In 1902, Griscom decided to merge his company with several other lines to create the International Mercantile Marine Company. The American name continued to exist under the IMM banner, but it was not until the trust's failure in 1932 that the American pieces of the combine were once again solely under the American flag, this time in the guise of United States Lines.\n\nShips\n, chartered to the Red Star Line 1895\u20131898 for seven voyages\n\n (also sailed as USS Yale, SS Philadelphia, and USS Harrisburg)\n, chartered to the Red Star Line 1901\u20131902 for four voyages\n, Haverford's sister ship, torpedoed and sunk in 1915 while acting as a decoy \"battlecruiser\"\n, chartered to the Red Star Line 1886\u20131897\n, chartered to the Red Star Line 1889\n, chartered to the Red Star Line 1895\u20131903\n, purchased from the Red Star Line in 1923, then sold to Panama Pacific Line\n, chartered from American Line 1887\u20131897\nPittsburgh,  chartered to the Red Star Line 1925\u20131926.

As the largest American shipping company at the time, it was rivalled only by the smaller Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines. However, it was dwarfed by British companies such as the White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG.
