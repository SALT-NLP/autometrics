It was a little overkill, if you asked her, but she did look pretty good.\n\n\"Here we are.\"\n\nThey were on the promenade now. It was quite a romantic place, like a faux Paris. Greenery and sidewalk cafes, people strolling about and window-shopping. Melanie thought she might like this part of the cruise the most.\n\nShe looked up and saw that they were in front of the pub. Billy Joel's Piano Man wafted from inside. Melanie smiled. \"I love pubs,\" she said. \"How did you know?\"\n\nDevon shrugged. \"I didn't. But I've been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it. Seemed like a good spot to start our date.\"\n\nIndeed it was. They sat down and ordered pints of Guinness. Melanie figured it would be better to order a drink she could nurse rather than something she might be inclined to pound if it were light or fruity.\n\n\"So, you're an actress, huh?\" Devon asked once they had their drinks in hand.\n\nShe hated talking about that part of her life. It had brought her so much joy in the past\u2014she had lived for performing. But now...now it just felt like something she was doing because it was the only thing she knew. And landing a show would be her escape\u2014albeit probably only a temporary one\u2014from waitressing. She currently had no other options for a career or even a job.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she finally said. \"Trying to be, anyway. It's been a while since I've performed, though.\"\n\nDevon gave her a wry smile. \"You just love waitressing too much to leave?\" he teased.\n\nShe laughed. \"You know it.\" Melanie paused. \"Actually, I hate being a waitress. And I'm horrible at it, for the record. Last week I nearly dumped a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs onto a two-year-old. Not my finest moment, but thankfully the kid's mom took most of the damage. Of course, my paycheck took some damage to pay for her Armani blouse.\"\n\n\"Who wears Armani to go out to eat with a two-year-old?\"\n\nMelanie looked up at Devon, surprised to realize that he was on her side. He was on her side. After being chewed out by Cliff for the humiliating accident and getting reactions like, \"Oh, my God! I can't believe you weren't fired!\" from her friends, she couldn't believe this near stranger actually empathized with her.\n\n\"Um, I know, right?\" she said, trying to hide the fact that she was completely flustered by his kindness. \"But anyway, enough about my insanely boring and depressing life. I want to hear about you.\"\nFive\n\nDevon took a deep breath. He liked this girl. A lot. He couldn't understand why.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nPlease rewrite this conversation to be more formal and also change the topic to what they are eating.\n\nThe first line should be something like \"Thank you for joining me for dinner, Mrs. Green.

The song was released in the US with different lyrics, titled \"Whenever You're Near Me\", and in a different key. It peaked at number-one in Hungary and was a top-ten hit in Denmark, Finland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and the UK. \"Life Is a Flower\" was certified silver in the UK by the BPI. It is written by band member Jonas Berggren, who in a 2015 interview described it as is his greatest Ace of Base song.\n\nCritical reception\nAllMusic editor Bryan Buss described the song as acoustic in his review. A reviewer from Evening Herald called it a gem, adding that \"more of the same can often be a good thing\". Swedish newspaper Expressen noted it as a \"safe card\". G\u00f6teborgsposten wrote that it is \"almost religiously positive\". Pan-European magazine Music &amp; Media commented that \"although the sound and style on the latest single remains unmistakably that of Ace Of Base, the Swedish outfit have still been able to reinvent themselves enough to stay relevant and keep pace with dance scene developments.\" Bernhard Hiller, head of music at AC\/CHR outlet 104.6 RTL\/Berlin said, \"It is a great comeback for them. The good thing is that they have managed to change their sound while still sounding like Ace Of Base.\" He added, \"Of course, this record is an absolute blessing for radio; we added it as soon as it got in, and currently we are playing it 15\u201320 times a week. At first audience response was less than overwhelming-but than again it is still early days; and besides, how can an audience like records when you don't allow the listeners to get to know the tracks?\"\n\nChart performance\n\"Life Is a Flower\" was a major hit on the charts in Europe, peaking at number-one in Hungary. Additionally, it managed to reach the Top 10 also in\nDenmark, Finland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the latter, the single went straight to number 5 in its first week at the UK Singles Chart, on 19 July 1998. It was also a Top 20 hit in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway and Switzerland, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it hit number 19 in August 1998. In Iceland and the Netherlands, \"Life Is a Flower\" went into the Top 30. Outside Europe, it was a hit in New Zealand, where it peaked at number 29. It earned a gold record in the band's native Sweden, with a sale of 15,000 singles and a silver record in the UK, after 200,000 units were sold there.\n\nMusic video\n\nTwo music videos of \"Life Is a Flower\" were shot. The first one was not finished and has never been released. It was rejected by the record label, although they had invested a lot of money in it. Scenography did not fit to the happy message of the song and it was found too dark and heavy. The second music video was officially released and is much more colourful and fun. Part of the storyboard was created by Jenny Berggren herself. Ace of Base also brought some elements of scenography on their own, like a washing machine. The video was uploaded to YouTube in January 2015.

The massive tyrannosaur, about nine metres long, lived in the coastal forest of what is now Alberta around 75 million years ago---preceding the more famous T. rex by about 10 million years.\n\nFor the first time, scientists in Canada and Argentina have used CT scans to digitally reconstruct the brain, inner ear, and surrounding bones (known as the braincase) of two well-preserved Daspletosaurus specimens.\n\nTheir results, published online today in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, counter a prevailing view that dinosaur brains and the bones enclosing and protecting them varied little within species, or among closely related species, especially when compared with changes observed in other parts of the skeleton. \u201cOur study with the two Daspletosaurus specimens suggests otherwise,\u201d explains Dr. Tetsuto Miyashita, palaeontologist with the Canadian Museum of Nature and senior author of the study.\n\n\u201cWe know that tyrannosaurs had relatively good-sized brains for a dinosaur, and this study shows that this pattern holds for Daspletosaurus. Furthermore, based on the shapes of the brain, ear structure, and braincase, we suggest that these two specimens represent distinct species of daspletosaurs.\u201d\n\nAccess to a braincase, the internal part of the skull that surrounds and protects the brain, helps unlock one of the most complex parts of dinosaur anatomy. This requires advanced medical technology such as a CT scanner to image the internal spaces hidden underneath thick bones, with the resulting hundreds of hours of work to reconstruct the brain and other fleshy parts slice by slice. Therefore, most studies on dinosaur brains have each focused on one specimen from a representative species of the group. As an exception, Tyrannosaurus rex has several such reconstructions of their brains. Now, this new study investigates two remarkably well-preserved skulls of Daspletosaurus, a much rarer tyrannosaur than T. rex.\n\nOne belongs to the original specimen of Daspletosaurus, which is prominently displayed at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. Unearthed in 1921 along the banks of Alberta\u2019s Red Deer River, its description in 1970 as Daspletosaurus torosus (\u201cmuscular frightful lizard)\u201d by Dr. Dale Russell ushered in the modern era of research on tyrannosaurids. The second specimen, uncovered in 2001, is with the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta. Miyashita is continuing to study it with Dr. Philip Currie of the University of Alberta, another author of the study.\n\nStudy of the braincase structure and its endocranial cavity provides insights on the brain itself, as well as characteristics such as the layout of cranial nerves, and some aspects of the sensory biology such as auditory and visual anatomy that drove the life of the dinosaur.                                                                                                                                  \n\nDr. Ariana Paulina Carabajal, a dinosaur braincase expert in Argentina and study co-author at the Instituto de Investigaciones en Biodiversidad y Medioambiente (CONICET-Universidad Nacional del Comahue), provided the detailed models of the brain and inner ear anatomy and related structures. Among the findings were the presence of large bony canals that would have transmitted thick nerve bundles that moved the eyeballs. The researchers also describe large air sacs that filled up most of the braincase bones, which is in line with the limited studies known of other tyrannosaurs.  \n\n\u201cThese cavities within the bones not only make the huge skull lighter, but also are related to the middle region of the ear,\u201d explains Paulina Carabajal. \u201cThe cavities probably helped to amplify sound and assist the system that communicates to the left and right ears, allowing the brain to determine where a sound is coming from.\u201d\n\nYet, even within the two braincases of Daspletosaurus, there were differences. \u201cIt was surprising to see so many variations in the braincases even though the skeletons are similar,\u201d says Miyashita, who offers that their study provides a good reason to look at more braincases within similar groups of dinosaurs, or even within species.\n\n\u201cResearchers have looked inside so few braincases in dinosaurs, typically one each for whatever species they studied, that this reinforced the assumption that these structures don\u2019t change much within and among species. We just haven\u2019t looked inside enough skulls to document variation.\u201d\n\nAdditional authors of the paper, entitled \u201cTwo braincases of Daspletosaurus (Theropoda: Tyrannosauridae): anatomy and comparison\u201d, are Thomas Dudgeon, and Dr. Hans Larsson of McGill University, who contributed the scanning data for the Canadian Museum of Nature specimen. The study authors are grateful to the Montfort Hospital in Ottawa, the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, and the Canada Diagnostic Centre in Calgary for access to their CT scanners.\n\"\"\"\nSummarize the findings and their implications for our understanding of dinosaur anatomy in at least 3 sentences.

Medical use of cannabis was legalized in 2018.\n\nHistory\n\nPortuguese overseas colonies\n\nGoa\nFollowing the Portuguese seizure of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese became familiar with the cannabis customs and trade in India. Garcia da Orta, a botanist and doctor, wrote about the uses of cannabis in his 1534 work Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs and Medicinal Matters of India and of a Few Fruits. Fifteen years later Cristobal Acosta produced the work A Tract about the Drugs and Medicines of the East Indies, outlining recipes for bhang.\n\nThe 1919 work Gloss\u00e1rio luso-asiatico noted the use of cannabis in Portugal's Indian colony of Goa:\nO bangue \u00e9 formado por folhas secas e hastes tentras de c\u00e2nhamo (Canabis sativa, Lin.) que se fumam ou mascam e que embriaga como o \u00f3pio.\n(Bangue is made of dry leaves and tender stemps of hemp, which they smoke or chew, and it intoxicates like opium.)\n\nBrazil\nCannabis was introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese colonists in the early 1800s. Their intent may have been to cultivate hemp fiber, but the enslaved Africans the Portuguese displaced from the west coast of Africa were familiar with cannabis and used it psychoactively, leading the Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro in 1830 to prohibit bringing cannabis into the city, and punishing its use by any slave.\n\nDecriminalization\nPossession of cannabis in Portugal is decriminalized in amounts for personal use, considered to be up to 25 grams of plant material or 5 grams of hashish.  In 2001 Portugal decriminalized all illegal drugs, meaning that possession of personal amounts (a 10-day supply) is not subject to any penalties for a first-time offense.  Subsequent offenses may be subject to civil penalties or mandated treatment.\n\nMedical use\nIn July 2018, legislation was signed into law to allow for the medical use of cannabis in Portugal and its dispensation at pharmacies.  Personal cultivation for medical use remains against the law.\n\"\"\"\nWhat is the cultural impact of cannabis in Portugal? How has cannabis use and trade influenced Portuguese culture and society over time?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe cultural impact of cannabis in Portugal has been significant. The use of cannabis in Portugal dates back to the 16th century, when it was introduced by Portuguese explorers. In the 19th century, cannabis use became widespread in Portugal, particularly among the enslaved population. Cannabis was used for both medicinal and recreational purposes.\n\nIn the 20th century, cannabis use became more restricted in Portugal, and it was criminalized in the 1960s. However, in 2001, Portugal made a significant shift in its drug policy by decriminalizing the possession of all drugs for personal use. This policy was implemented in response to the rising number of drug-related deaths and the realization that criminalization was not effectively reducing drug use.\n\nThe decriminalization of cannabis in Portugal has had a significant impact on the country's culture and society. It has reduced the number of people arrested and imprisoned for minor drug offenses, freeing up resources to focus on more serious crimes. It has also reduced the stigma surrounding drug use, allowing for more open discussions about drug use and addiction.\n\nAdditionally, the legal status of cannabis in Portugal has allowed for the development of a thriving medical cannabis industry. In 2018, legislation was signed into law to allow for the medical use of cannabis in Portugal and its dispensation at pharmacies. However, personal cultivation for medical use remains against the law.\n\nOverall, the cultural impact of cannabis in Portugal has been complex and multifaceted, reflecting the changing attitudes and policies surrounding drug use and addiction in the country.\u00bb\u00bb",
