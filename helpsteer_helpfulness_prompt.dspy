Supported by some of Berlin\u2019s most prominent occultists, the plaintiff \u2013 the medium\u2019s husband \u2013 argued that Moll\u2019s use of terms such as \u2018trick\u2019, \u2018manipulation\u2019 and \u2018farce\u2019 in reference to Vollhardt\u2019s phenomena had been libellous. \n\nIn the three-part trial that followed, however, Moll\u2019s putative affront to the medium \u2013 of which he was eventually acquitted \u2013 was overshadowed, on the one hand, by a debate over the scientific status of parapsychology, and on the other, by the question of whom \u2013 parapsychologists, occultists, psychiatrists, or jurists \u2013 was entitled to claim epistemic authority over the occult. This paper will use the Rudloff\u2013Moll trial as a means of examining Moll\u2019s critique of occultism, not only as it stood in the mid-1920s, but also as it had developed since the 1880s. It will also provide insight into the views of Germany\u2019s occultists and parapsychologists, who argued that their legitimate bid for scientific credibility was hindered by Dunkelm\u00e4nner [obscurantists] such as Albert Moll.\n\nIn July 1925, the psychiatrist Albert Moll appeared before the district court in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg charged with having defamed the apport medium Maria Vollhardt \u2013 pseudonym of Maria Rudloff. The plaintiff, Hermann Rudloff \u2013 the medium\u2019s husband \u2013 claimed that the defendant\u2019s use of terms such as \u2018trick\u2019, \u2018manipulation\u2019 and \u2018farce\u2019 in his 1924 book, Der Spiritismus [Spiritism] \u2013 a brief section of which, entitled \u2018Das Apportmedium\u2019 [\u2018The Apport Medium\u2019], described a sitting with Frau Vollhardt \u2013 had been libellous. \n\nWhile Moll had not explicitly used the words \u2018deception\u2019 or \u2018fraud\u2019 in his depiction of the medium\u2019s phenomena, Rudloff maintained that these accusations had nonetheless been clear, causing profound damage to his wife\u2019s reputation. He was supported in this contention by some of Berlin\u2019s most prominent parapsychologists, several of whom had been present at the experiment Moll\u2019s book described. These parapsychologists claimed that the defendant, mistaking personal attack for scientific critique, was responsible for the coarse tone of debate which now plagued their field. \n\nPresented with this argument, the presiding judge, one Herr Bornemann, was required to decide whether Moll\u2019s portrayal of Frau Vollhardt met the criteria for defamation as set out under Sections 186 and 187 of the Republic\u2019s penal code. As Judge Bornemann soon discovered, however, the Rudloff\u2013Moll case was rather more complex than it first appeared. In a context in which the reality of the central phenomena, that is, apports, materialization and stigmata, were debated and in which the issues of epistemic authority and expertise over these phenomena were highly contested, ascertaining whether the outspoken defendant was guilty of defaming the medium or of overstepping the acceptable bounds of critique within the nascent field of parapsychology would not be straightforward.\n\nMoll\u2019s annotated reproduction in Der Spiritismus of a protocol derived from Friedrich Schwab\u2019s book Teleplasma und Telekinese had provided a thoroughgoing critique of an experiment conducted by Berlin\u2019s leading occultists \u2013 including the doctors Carl Bruck and Paul S\u00fcnner, members of the \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr parapsychische Forschung\u2013 on 11 April 1923. 7 In part, this critique sought to demonstrate the manner in which Vollhardt\u2019s phenomena, in particular the appearance of wooden hoops on the arms of those acting as her controls, could be achieved manually, that is, through skillful \u2018trick\u2019 and \u2018manipulation\u2019. \n\nWith reference to both the art of conjuring and the psychology of observation, Moll argued that in this instance the medium had most probably slipped the hoops onto her arms before control of her hands had been established, but after the room had been darkened. He maintained, furthermore, that the transfer of the hoops onto the arms of Vollhardt\u2019s controls had undoubtedly occurred as she underwent the convulsions that routinely accompanied the production of her mediumistic phenomena. To demonstrate the ease with which Vollhardt could have escaped her controls, Moll also provided several illustrations, derived from contemporary works in the field of parapsychology, in which the mediums pictured successfully freed their hands from those who were holding them.\n\nThe other, and perhaps more significant, purpose of Moll\u2019s critique, however, was to highlight the profound, even \u2018farcical\u2019, lack of scientific rigor exhibited by Berlin\u2019s foremost parapsychologists. From the opening pages of Der Spiritismus, Moll\u2019s desire to undermine the scientific pretensions of this community had been clear. In the introductory section, he noted that the term \u2018occultism\u2019 had, in recent times, been used to refer to the practice of spiritualism: a belief system based on the idea that spirits are able to communicate with human beings. Moll wrote that it appeared to him that some people chose to use the terms \u2018occultism\u2019 and \u2018parapsychology\u2019 because they did not want to admit to being spiritualists. Thus, at the beginning of his second chapter, Moll declared his intention of providing descriptions of some of the experiments held by these putative occultists; such depictions, he stated, would make the true \u2013 that is, spiritualist \u2013 nature of these sittings clear. \n\nThe heavily annotated protocol at the center of the Rudloff\u2013Moll trial, which appeared in the seventh chapter of Moll\u2019s book, clearly served this purpose. Full of righteous indignation, Moll wrote: \u2018the experiments were made under such incredibly thoughtless conditions that one can only speak of a farce. The medium was not searched beforehand\u2026. That is what the Berlin occultists call science!\u2019 While Schwab had published this same protocol believing that its verification by the doctors and psychiatrists who had been in attendance made it significant, Moll commented snidely that its true importance lay in its documentation of the mental state of Berlin\u2019s leading occultists. He stated, \u201cI have only used the experiment and my remarks about it therefore because they quickly cast light on the mental state of the leaders of Berlin occultism. The trick is so crude that the whole case only deserves consideration because of the frame of mind of the occultists.\u201d\n###\n\nHow did the issue of epistemic authority over the occult play a role in the trial, and what were the key points of Moll's critique of occultism and his portrayal of the medium Maria Vollhardt in his book \u201cDer Spiritismus\u201d?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe Rudloff-Moll trial centered on Moll's critique of occultism in his book \"Der Spiritismus\" and his use of terms such as \"trick,\" \"manipulation,\" and \"farce\" to describe Maria Vollhardt's (pseudonym of Maria Rudloff) apport medium phenomena. Moll's portrayal of the medium was seen as a personal attack by the parapsychologists who supported Rudloff, and the issue of epistemic authority over the occult was highly contested. Moll's critique was based on his annotated reproduction of a protocol derived from Friedrich Schwab's book \"Teleplasma und Telekinese,\" which demonstrated the manner in which Vollhardt's phenomena could be achieved manually. He also highlighted the lack of scientific rigor exhibited by Berlin's foremost parapsychologists.\u00bb\u00bb",

Surviving the stock-footage explosion with only third-degree burns, the Colonel malfunctions and goes on a lusty rampage, pursued (on scooter) by Dr Karen.\n\nSure, it's cheap, silly and loaded with enough stock-footage to make Ed Wood proud, but the campy feel must've been intentional because producer Alan V Iselin's resume also includes The Horror Of Party Beach. Here, the beach antics have been toned down, the number of pop songs reduced and there's more going on whenever the antagonists are off-screen.\n\nFriday The 13th Part II (1981)\n\nThe first Friday The 13th was a blah Halloween knock off directed by a porn grad, but this sequel is the archetypal 80s slasher movie, full of idiot victims (love that skinny dipping blonde) who die in unpleasant ways courtesy of a machete-wielding villain who won't stay dead.\n\nIt's basically an Americanization of Mario Bava's A Bay Of Blood, and even recreates two murders from that film (the machete to the face and the spearing of the two lovers). On its American rerelease, Bava's film was marketed as an unofficial sequel to The Last House On The Left, which is ironic: Steve Miner, who called the shots on Friday The 13th parts 2 and 3, was a production assistant on Last House.\n\nUnlike several of the later sequels, Part II is a bona fide exploitation movie that serves up all the blood, shocks and gratuitous nudity a crowd could want. Several sympathetic characters bite the dust in horrific ways, and it's a very nasty movie indeed that reserves one of the most unpleasant (and admittedly spectacular) deaths for the sole handicapped character. It's not a movie long on PC or feminism, but it is loads of down and dirty fun.\n\nFrightmare (1974)\n\nVery different from the quaint and cosy horrors being produced by Hammer at the time, Pete Walker's films are all about \"making mischief\", the kind that involves gratuitous nudity, cynical digs at the establishment and Sheila Keith, his perennial supporting actress, wielding a power drill.\n\nA fine introduction to Planet Walker, Frightmare is the story of Edmund (Rupert Yates), who must cover up for his wife Dorothy (Keith) when she's released from an asylum and immediately reverts to her old ways by killing strangers to satisfy her hunger for human flesh. You know how it is in Surrey.\n\nOne of the few British horrors that set out to match the nastiness of the low-budget American films of the period, Frightmare has an ace up its sleeve in the form of Keith, a sweet old lady who kills her victims with pokers, pitchforks and the aforementioned drill. The latter image was used for the film's poster, along with the tagline, \"Dare you see the film that shocked the critics?\"\n\nFrom Beyond The Grave (1974)\n\nAccording to Hollywood, anthology films never work and fail commercially, so it fell to Amicus to make the pictures that came to define the genre (Dr Terror's House Of Horrors, Torture Garden, The House That Dripped Blood etc.), the most fun of which is From Beyond The Grave.\n\nClever, atmospheric and (at times) very funny, the film comprises four stories (based on the work of R Chetwynd-Hayes) linked by Peter Cushing's antique shop, Temptations Ltd, which has \"lots of bargains.\n<end of reference>\nWrite a list format summary of the four horror movies described in at least 5 bulleted points for a movie buff.\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abFrankenstein Meets The Space Monster: A Lily Munster-ish Martian princess and her bald, pointy-eared servant kidnap bikinied 'specimens' from the beaches of San Juan to repopulate their dying world.\n\nFriday The 13th Part II: The archetypal 80s slasher movie with idiot victims who die in unpleasant ways courtesy of a machete-wielding villain who won't stay dead.\n\nFrightmare: Very different from the quaint and cozy horrors being produced by Hammer at the time, Pete Walker's films are all about \"making mischief.\"\n\nFrom Beyond The Grave: A clever, atmospheric, and (at times) very funny anthology film comprising four stories linked by Peter Cushing's antique shop, Temptations Ltd.\u00bb\u00bb",

Most of us fail to realise that being courteous speaks volume of us. Courtesy means being polite and treating others with equal respect as you would treat yourself. The common question is, where has courtesy gone in our society?\n\nCourtesy and manners go hand-in-hand as courtesy means putting good manner into practice. Showing consideration and good manners brings out a feeling of worth which being courteous entails. The problem with common courtesy is that it is easily forgotten by people. So little effort is required to be courteous; actually, it takes less effort and energy to be courteous than to be brusque. Everyone wants to be acknowledged and appreciated. To be able to achieve that, you need to be courteous towards people if you desire the same treatment for yourself. Even in situations where you have authority over some people and you need to tell them what to do, you must not exert a negative authority over them. It is more pleasant to ask them in a courteous way. Bosses who treat their subordinates with courtesy always have a much loyal and productive staff.\n\nCommon courtesy centres on the realization that there are people around us who also share the environment with us. Showing courtesy shows the kind of upbringing which we had. Small courtesies will take a person further in life than expected. Courtesy shows politeness, it costs nothing but pays well. No one is too big or busy to practise courtesy. Courtesy is nothing, something that will require a specific training. But it could be a warm smile or a simple acknowledgement like \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cI am sorry\u201d when you go wrong. Courtesy is one of the little things that make a huge difference in life. A courteous person that has no wealth is more likeable than one who is wealthy and is not courteous. Courtesy is very important in life because when you are courteous people have a good impression of you and respect automatically follows, instead of hatred.

Its headwaters are on the eastern slope of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range in Mora County north of Pecos, NM, at an elevation of over 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m). The river flows for 926 miles (1,490\u00a0km) before reaching the Rio Grande near Del Rio. Its drainage basin encompasses about 44,300 square miles (115,000\u00a0km2).\n\nThe name \"Pecos\" derives from the Keresan (Native American language) term for the Pecos Pueblo, [p'\u00e6yok'ona]. The river was also historically referred to as the R\u00edo Natag\u00e9s for the Mescalero people.\n\nHistory\nThe river played a large role in the exploration of Texas by the Spanish. In the latter half of the 19th century, \"West of the Pecos\" was a reference to the rugged desolation of the Wild West. The Texas storekeeper, bartender, and justice of the peace, Roy Bean, a native of Kentucky, was often described as \"The Only Law West of the Pecos\", a phrase made popular from the 1956 syndicated television series, Judge Roy Bean, with Edgar Buchanan in the starring role. In the series narration, \"West of the Pecos\" is described as:\nthe wildest spot in the United States ... virtually beyond the reach of the authorities, the railroads, then pushing their way west, attracted the most vicious characters in the country. It was said that all civilization and law stopped at the east bank of the Pecos. It took one man, a lone storekeeper who was sick of the lawlessness, to change all this. His name was Judge Roy Bean.\"\n\nNew Mexico and Texas disputed water rights to the river until the U.S. government settled the dispute in 1949 with the Pecos River Compact. The Pecos River Settlement Agreement was signed between New Mexico and Texas in 2003.\n\nDams\nMultiple dams have been built along the Pecos River. Santa Rosa Lake is 117 miles\/188\u00a0km east of Albuquerque. Sumner Lake, formed by the 1939 Sumner Dam, is located between Santa Rosa and Fort Sumner, NM. Two dams are located north of Carlsbad, New Mexico, at Avalon Dam and Brantley Dam, to help irrigate about  as part of the Carlsbad reclamation project (established in 1906).

Edmonds (May 7, 1922 \u2013 April 16, 2005) was a biochemist who made key discoveries regarding the processing of messenger RNA (mRNA). She spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nEducation and career \nEdmonds was born May 7, 1922 in Racine, Wisconsin. She received a Bachelor's degree from Milwaukee-Downer College in 1943, a master's degree from Wellesley College in 1945, and a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951. Following her Ph.D., she was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Illinois (1950-1952) and University of Wisconsin (1952-1955), and then joined Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburg as a research associate from 1955 until 1965. Starting in 1962 she held appointments at the University of Pittsburgh, initially as adjunct and research professor positions, until she joined the faculty in 1971 and was promoted to professor in 1976.\n\nEdmonds took emeritus status in 1992, and died of complications related to a heart attack on April 16, 2005.\n\nResearch \nEdmonds was known for her research in mRNA processing, specifically on 3'-end processing and how RNA is spliced. Her research showed that the end of mRNA is a poly-A tail composed of multiple adenosine residues. In her memoirs posted at the National Academy of Sciences, her work discovering the poly-A tails on eukaryotic mRNA and purification of the poly-A polymerase enzyme are described as \"landmarks in the field\". Edmonds also developed the first method to use the poly-A tail to separate mRNA from other nucleic acids, a protocol which forms the beginning of all modern transcriptomics analysis. In the 1980s, Edmonds showed that poly-A RNA is branched, a stage that arises during processing of hnRNA into mRNA. This research led to the development of antibodies targeting branched RNA.\n\nSelected publications\n\nAwards and accolades \nEdmonds was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991.

Worthless snippets of others lives that she was forced to store in the labyrinth of her mind. The cursed labyrinth that trapped her and kept her young. She took their money, their memory and their time.\n\n\"Fay,\" a gruff voice called out. \"You done here?\"\n\nLike an extinguished flame, the memory vanished at the harsh voice. But it had been close to ending anyway. Caprice opened her eyes and found Charles standing with two hot dogs by his wife's side, nudging her with an impatient hip. His face folded with irritation. Fay traveling back to spend time with another man made sense.\n\nCaprice slipped her hand from Fay's and watched her come back. Her eyes fluttered open and cheeks pinked with energy and remembrance.\n\nFay looked as if she might cry at first.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered and placed her hand on her heart as if to catch her breath.\n\nOr maybe it was to calm her loss.\n\nCaprice didn't spend another second thinking about Fay and her memory because they were all like this. Invasive and exhausting and entirely too revealing.\n\n\"She went back for another man?\" Devin asked when they were out of earshot. \"Didn't she?\"\n\nCaprice nodded. \"Why?\" She broke her own rule and spoke outside a transaction.\n\n\"Because she was muttering Kev over and over while she was with you. And did you see how flushed she was when she woke. Was it good?\" He winked at her.\n\nThe name rang a bell once he said it. Caprice supposed she heard it while in the memory, but specifics weren't welcome to stay. \"Do I speak during...?\" she asked.\n\nDevin smiled. He had a nice smile, even and straight, well, except for the color of his teeth. \"Nope, you hum.\"\n\nHis answer surprised her. \"I hum?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yep, it goes like this.\" Cacophonous sounds escaped his mouth. They vibrated around her ears like soldiers with bayonets stabbing her eardrums. She covered her ears to stop it.\n\nHe flashed his smile again. \"I'm not that bad, am I?\"\n\nCaprice nodded. But it wasn't his voice that was horrendous, although it was bad, the tune inflicted pain.\n\nDevin and Caprice sat quietly for an hour with a handful of customers coming and going.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat are the consequences of Caprice's actions? How does she justify what she does? What are the possible consequences of the power she has?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abCaprice takes people's memories as part of her job. She spends her time traveling with them to sacred places, which makes their memories hers. She believes this is a consequence of her job, and she has no control over it. She says it's an occupational hazard. The problem is that the memories take up space in her mind, which is already overloaded with useless information that she can't get rid of.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "reasoning": "The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the consequences of Caprice's actions, specifically the fact that she takes people's memories as part of her job and that these memories become hers, taking up space in her mind. The response also touches on the idea that Caprice views this as an occupational hazard, implying that she has no control over it. However, the response could be improved by providing more depth and analysis of the consequences of Caprice's power and how she justifies her actions.",
