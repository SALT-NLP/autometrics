It may be tempting to push saving to another day, when you're earning more money or have fewer bills. However, that day may or may not arrive, and the longer you wait to start saving, the harder it will be to catch up.\n\nHowever, it's easier than you may think to save more now, even if you don't have a lot of cash to spare. It comes down to one simple thing that will set you up for future financial success.\n\nHand stacking coins\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nWhy planning is the key to your financial future\n\nOnly 28% of Americans have a written financial plan, according to a survey from Charles Schwab. However, of those who do have a plan, 63% say they feel financially secure.\n\nThe reasons why most people aren't planning for the future vary. Nearly half (46%) say they don't have enough money to create a financial plan, the survey found, 18% think coming up with a plan is too complicated, and 13% say they don't have time to create one.\n\nRegardless of the reason why you may not have a financial plan in place, it can make a big difference when it comes to your savings.\n\nNearly 80% of those who have a written financial plan are able to pay their bills and save each month, compared to just 38% of those who don't have a plan. Also, 74% of people with a plan automate a portion of their income to go directly to their savings each month, while only 25% of those without a financial plan do so.\n\nBy creating a financial plan, you'll not only establish a long-term goal, but it can also make it easier to save each month. Instead of blindly setting aside what you can and hoping it's enough, you'll have a monthly goal to aim for to achieve success.\n\nHow to create a successful financial plan\n\nYour financial plan depends on the goals you're trying to reach. Saving for retirement is one of the biggest (and most challenging) financial goals, so it requires the most planning.\n\nThe first step to creating a retirement plan is to set a saving goal. How much you need to save for retirement is highly dependent on your individual situation, including how many years you expect to spend in retirement and how much you plan to spend each year. Run your numbers through a retirement calculator to get an estimate of how much you'll need to save, as well as how much you should be saving each month to reach that goal.\n\nAlso, don't forget about how Social Security benefits will impact your retirement savings. By creating a my Social Security account, you can get an estimate of what you'll receive in benefits based on your current earnings. While your benefits alone probably won't be enough to cover all your expenses in retirement, they can certainly help some -- and the more you know about how much you're set to receive in benefits, the more accurate your financial plan will be.\n\nOnce you have a goal in mind and know what you should be saving each month to achieve it, write it down. When you write down your goals, you're more likely to achieve them than if you simply think about them, a study from Dominican University of California found. Writing down your goals and the action steps you're taking to reach them helps hold yourself accountable, ensuring you'll stick to your plan long-term.\n\nThe most comprehensive financial plans also look at your overall financial health, not just savings. For instance, if you're in debt, you should ideally have a plan in place for paying that down. An emergency fund is also important, because unexpected expenses will inevitably pop up -- and they could potentially throw off your entire plan if you don't have the money set aside to pay them.\n\nWhether you decide to create a financial plan on your own or with the help of a financial advisor, having a strategy in place for managing your money can make it easier to save for the future. No matter what you're earning or how much you have to save, a solid financial plan is always a good investment.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWho is this text intended for?\n- Financial advisors\n- Those interested in retirement planning\n- People struggling with their finances\n- Anyone looking to save money\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThis text is intended for anyone looking to save money.

The spirits took notice and desisted their entreaties, still staring but no longer grabbing. Even the girl who was almost identical to Lulu.\n\nAhead of her, the sea of spirits parted. A dog trotted forward.\n\n\"The dog's name is Zora,\" Supergirl said, beside her again. \"She knows the way. There's one more thing: \"Don't look behind the curtain.\" She disappeared. Zora was white with black spots, but bigger than Bob.\n\nThe dog barked and ran a few feet forward, looking back at Lulu before barking again.\n\n\"She wants us to follow,\" Lulu said to nobody in particular, since Reggie couldn't be considered an interlocutor.\n\n\"Indeed she does,\" said a spirit beside her who was a man dressed in leather with an old aviator's hat on. \"That's my plane over there.\" He pointed at a plane with the name \"Miss Veedol,\" painted on the side. \"I'm Clyde, how about a plane ride, miss?\"\n\n\"I don't think I have time just now,\" Lulu answered, but how was she to know if she was supposed to get on the plane?\n\nZora, the dog, barked again, returning to her to tug her pant leg. She was pretty clearly told to follow the dog, so, she decided that was probably what she should do.\n\n\"Perhaps next time, but thank you,\" Lulu answered.\n\n\"Very well, I've hauntings to attend to, and I'm sure you'll be back. Remember to check the tortillas from time to time.\" He turned and moved toward the plane and Lulu, Chupacabra repellent in hand, followed. The spirits, adults and children, young and old, watched her pass, but didn't reach out.\n\n\"This is the land of the spirits to which there's always an opening in Sugarland,\" Lulu heard Supergirl by her right ear, where currently there was no actual person to make the sound. \"It's a good place to visit for advice, but you don't have time for tea right now. If you stop to visit, you'll never get out of here in time. Look at the tree.\"\n\nLulu looked around and saw, off to the left, a tree filled with what looked like flame, although the tree was not consumed. It was more like it was luminescing. She moved closer 'til she could see that it was a fruit tree. Fig. It was beautiful. Then she saw the snake in the branches. It was red and white, like one of the candy cane serpents from the witch's hair. It flickered its black tongue. Above the tree was a rainbow cast in the dark sky. Her eye was drawn back down to the tree, which was now made entirely of those striped snakes and they were all tongue flickering in the strange luminescence. She marveled at it for a moment before remembering that she was running short on time.\n\n\"Come on, Reggie.\"\n\nReggie ambled along, not saying a word.\n\nThis version of Reggie was better than the original, but Supergirl was right, the monkey idea still weighed heavily on her mind. She had also heard that talking to one's self was a bad practice. Oh, well. Horses were leaving port and ships escaping barns.\n\nZora barked and ran ahead, the spirits parting for her.\n\n\"The spirit dog knows the way and she can protect you.\" Supergirl was saying something else but her voice was fading to a whisper and Lulu couldn't make it out.\n\n**C** **hapter 22: Self Help**\n\nLulu was somewhat relieved when the spirits began to thin out. It seemed to Lulu that they were losing interest.\n\nJust as she thought what a nice night it was becoming, her night vision so clarified and lit by the jeweled crown, she heard a rattling sound and the last spirits who'd been hanging around dissipated like puffs of smoke. She scanned the area and it took only an instant to see what the concern was. Sugar skeletons. A mob of them was running toward Lulu and Reggie, looking exactly like Day of the Dead skeletons with brightly decorated skulls. It was a terrifying sight. They arrived in front of Lulu in seconds and came to a stop. There were at least a dozen of them. One who was dressed as a ballerina with a pink tutu stood directly in front of Lulu.\n\nZora stood beside Lulu growling, hackles standing like a ridge on her back.\n\n\"What do you two think you're doing here?\" the ballerina asked, tossing her curly red mane with a mean girl flourish.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nWhat is the significance of the spirits and the strange phenomena in the story? How do they relate to the main characters and the overall plot?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe spirits and strange phenomena in the story are related to the main characters and the overall plot in a few different ways.\n\nFirst, the spirits are portrayed as a manifestation of the characters' imaginations and emotions, particularly those of the main character, Lulu. They represent the challenges and obstacles that she faces in her life, as well as the internal struggles and conflicts that she is grappling with. The strange phenomena, such as the glowing crown and the barking dog, are symbolic of the supernatural and otherworldly elements that are present in the story. They serve as a representation of the mysterious and unknown, and can be seen as a reflection of the larger themes of magic and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nSecond, the spirits and the strange phenomena are also related to the main character's quest for self-discovery and self-improvement. The spirits are a representation of the various aspects of Lulu's personality and character, both positive and negative, and they provide her with guidance and advice as she navigates the challenges of her life. The strange phenomena, such as the glowing tree and the red and white snakes, can be seen as a representation of the spiritual and mystical aspects of the story, and they serve as a reminder of the importance of seeking guidance and advice from the supernatural realm.\n\nOverall, the spirits and the strange phenomena in the story serve as a representation of the inner workings of the characters' minds and the larger themes of the story. They are a manifestation of the characters' innermost thoughts and emotions, and they help to drive the plot forward as Lulu navigates the challenges of her life and seeks to improve herself.\u00bb\u00bb",

        "text": "\u00abInput (prompt): \u00abReference:\nWhat happened in the fusion chamber?\nFusion is a nuclear reaction that combines two atoms to create one or more new atoms with slightly less total mass. The difference in mass is released as energy, as described by Einstein\u2019s famous equation, E = mc2 , where energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since the speed of light is enormous, converting just a tiny amount of mass into energy \u2013 like what happens in fusion \u2013 produces a similarly enormous amount of energy.\n\nResearchers at the U.S. Government\u2019s National Ignition Facility in California have demonstrated, for the first time, what is known as \u201cfusion ignition.\u201d Ignition is when a fusion reaction produces more energy than is being put into the reaction from an outside source and becomes self-sustaining.\n\nThe technique used at the National Ignition Facility involved shooting 192 lasers at a 0.04 inch (1 mm) pellet of fuel made of deuterium and tritium \u2013 two versions of the element hydrogen with extra neutrons \u2013 placed in a gold canister. When the lasers hit the canister, they produce X-rays that heat and compress the fuel pellet to about 20 times the density of lead and to more than 5 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million Celsius) \u2013 about 100 times hotter than the surface of the Sun. If you can maintain these conditions for a long enough time, the fuel will fuse and release energy.\n\nThe fuel and canister get vaporized within a few billionths of a second during the experiment. Researchers then hope their equipment survived the heat and accurately measured the energy released by the fusion reaction.\n\nSo what did they accomplish?\nTo assess the success of a fusion experiment, physicists look at the ratio between the energy released from the process of fusion and the amount of energy within the lasers. This ratio is called gain.\n\nAnything above a gain of 1 means that the fusion process released more energy than the lasers delivered.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 2022, the National Ignition Facility shot a pellet of fuel with 2 million joules of laser energy \u2013 about the amount of power it takes to run a hair dryer for 15 minutes \u2013 all contained within a few billionths of a second. This triggered a fusion reaction that released 3 million joules. That is a gain of about 1.5, smashing the previous record of a gain of 0.7 achieved by the facility in August 2021.\n\nHow big a deal is this result?\nFusion energy has been the \u201choly grail\u201d of energy production for nearly half a century. While a gain of 1.5 is, I believe, a truly historic scientific breakthrough, there is still a long way to go before fusion is a viable energy source.\n\nWhile the laser energy of 2 million joules was less than the fusion yield of 3 million joules, it took the facility nearly 300 million joules to produce the lasers used in this experiment. This result has shown that fusion ignition is possible, but it will take a lot of work to improve the efficiency to the point where fusion can provide a net positive energy return when taking into consideration the entire end-to-end system, not just a single interaction between the lasers and the fuel.\n\nWhat needs to be improved?\nThere are a number of pieces of the fusion puzzle that scientists have been steadily improving for decades to produce this result, and further work can make this process more efficient.\n\nFirst, lasers were only invented in 1960. When the U.S. government completed construction of the National Ignition Facility in 2009, it was the most powerful laser facility in the world, able to deliver 1 million joules of energy to a target. The 2 million joules it produces today is 50 times more energetic than the next most powerful laser on Earth. More powerful lasers and less energy-intensive ways to produce those powerful lasers could greatly improve the overall efficiency of the system.\n\nFusion conditions are very challenging to sustain, and any small imperfection in the capsule or fuel can increase the energy requirement and decrease efficiency. Scientists have made a lot of progress to more efficiently transfer energy from the laser to the canister and the X-ray radiation from the canister to the fuel capsule, but currently only about 10% to 30% of the total laser energy is transferred to the canister and to the fuel.\n\nFinally, while one part of the fuel, deuterium, is naturally abundant in sea water, tritium is much rarer. Fusion itself actually produces tritium, so researchers are hoping to develop ways of harvesting this tritium directly. In the meantime, there are other methods available to produce the needed fuel.\n\nThese and other scientific, technological and engineering hurdles will need to be overcome before fusion will produce electricity for your home. Work will also need to be done to bring the cost of a fusion power plant well down from the US$3.5 billion of the National Ignition Facility. These steps will require significant investment from both the federal government and private industry.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is a global race around fusion, with many other labs around the world pursuing different techniques. But with the new result from the National Ignition Facility, the world has, for the first time, seen evidence that the dream of fusion is achievable.\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the passage about the fusion ignition, how many lasers were shot? What type of lasers were fired and the sizing of them?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThere were 192 lasers that were shot. These lasers were a type of laser that is called neodymium glass.

Nick, Nick Frye, her official, for-real boyfriend. Her cheeks felt as red as his looked. \"W-when I went before it was always with girls, so it was easy. We'd be twins, or ballerinas, or princesses. I guess maybe I could be a ballerina, and you could be a, a ballerin...o?\"\n\nNick shrugged.\n\n\"Well, how about a prince and princess?\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Nick said.\n\n\"Mummies?\"\n\nNick chewed his lip.\n\n\"Okay, well, did you have something in mind?\"\n\n\"That Doctor fella,\" Nick said, eyeing the poster. He'd watched a few episodes with her, at her initial insistence; she suspected he was now nurturing a slight affection for the show, but still thought it was weird. Well, that was okay, because it was weird.\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe we could go as him and Sarah Jane.\"\n\nSomething in Addy quailed at that. She loved the Doctor, but in her head, she always saw herself as the one in the coat and scarf and floppy hat, uttering bewildering truisms as she dodged Daleks and Cybermen and Zygons. On the other hand, Nick was now officially her for-real boyfriend, he had the curly brown hair, and she was feeling indescribably magnanimous. \"Uh, sure. Yeah, that'd be cool. I mean Dad has a coat and hat that would probably fit you, and I bet we could find a scarf somewhere...\"\n\n\"Oh, n-no,\" Nick said. \"That ain't what I was thinkin'. You know the show a lot better'n me, I mean you'd have to be the Doctor, and I was just wonderin' if maybe you, if you, if you... got a Sarah Jane kinda dress that I might fit into.\"\n\nFor the second time in as many minutes, Addy didn't know what to say. Then several things fell together into a new kind of clarity, and she understood, and she smiled; and Nick earned himself another kiss. Then he got a few more, because that was what happened when you and your brand-new boyfriend found out that kissing was actually kind of somewhat pretty nice. It was a lot more interesting to be doing it herself than it was to watch on some dumb mushy TV show, that was for sure. Nick seemed to agree.\n\nThen she broke out the nail polish, lipstick, rouge, and mascara, and after half an hour had Nick looking a lot like Sarah Jane. Well, from the neck up. Sort of. In the dark, maybe.\n\n...Really, he didn't look much like Elisabeth Sladen to begin with, but he did look like a girl, which he said was \"better than lipstick on a pig, anyhow,\" and that got them both giggling, and it didn't stop until they rediscovered kissing for a while.\n\nBy the time dinner was ready she had half his wardrobe picked out: A blouse and vest, tights and some low heels that fit him and didn't make him feel too wobbly. She didn't have any long skirts, she told him, but she had friends who did, and it would be easy to borrow one. \"Couldn't I just wear somethin' like that?\" he said, gesturing to her buttondown shirt-style dress in October hues of burnt orange and a dark brown collar and placket, coordinated with long stockings.\n\nShe looked down. \"I don't think it's girly enough. On you, it'd just look like a big shirt. I think we need a real skirt, Nick.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're prob'ly right,\" he nodded.\n\n\"Now put your pants back on. It's dinnertime, and I'm hungry.\"\n\nThey went into the dining room hand in hand, both of them still made up; she and Nick both did significant damage to the stew and soft rolls that accompanied it. Addy knew her appetite was because she was that age, according to the various and sundry adults in her life, and Nick was a growing strapping lad. According to her memory, she'd been that age for at least five years now. She wondered if Nick had been strapping since 1970, as well.\n\nShe helped clear away the dishes while Dad brought in the pumpkins. Nick selected a low, squat one; Addy went with one that was shaped a little like an egg. Her other mom set them up with a boning knife for the deep, rough cuts, a pair of smaller carvers for the more controlled shapes, and a big slotted spoon to scoop out the pumpkin guts with.\n<end of reference>\nWhat is the overall mood of the text?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThe overall mood of the text is light-hearted and fun.\u00bb\u00bb",

However, of those who do have a plan, 63% say they feel financially secure.\n\nThe reasons why most people aren't planning for the future vary. Nearly half (46%) say they don't have enough money to create a financial plan, the survey found, 18% think coming up with a plan is too complicated, and 13% say they don't have time to create one.\n\nRegardless of the reason why you may not have a financial plan in place, it can make a big difference when it comes to your savings.\n\nNearly 80% of those who have a written financial plan are able to pay their bills and save each month, compared to just 38% of those who don't have a plan. Also, 74% of people with a plan automate a portion of their income to go directly to their savings each month, while only 25% of those without a financial plan do so.\n\nBy creating a financial plan, you'll not only establish a long-term goal, but it can also make it easier to save each month. Instead of blindly setting aside what you can and hoping it's enough, you'll have a monthly goal to aim for to achieve success.\n\nHow to create a successful financial plan\n\nYour financial plan depends on the goals you're trying to reach. Saving for retirement is one of the biggest (and most challenging) financial goals, so it requires the most planning.\n\nThe first step to creating a retirement plan is to set a saving goal. How much you need to save for retirement is highly dependent on your individual situation, including how many years you expect to spend in retirement and how much you plan to spend each year. Run your numbers through a retirement calculator to get an estimate of how much you'll need to save, as well as how much you should be saving each month to reach that goal.\n\nAlso, don't forget about how Social Security benefits will impact your retirement savings. By creating a my Social Security account, you can get an estimate of what you'll receive in benefits based on your current earnings. While your benefits alone probably won't be enough to cover all your expenses in retirement, they can certainly help some -- and the more you know about how much you're set to receive in benefits, the more accurate your financial plan will be.\n\nOnce you have a goal in mind and know what you should be saving each month to achieve it, write it down. When you write down your goals, you're more likely to achieve them than if you simply think about them, a study from Dominican University of California found. Writing down your goals and the action steps you're taking to reach them helps hold yourself accountable, ensuring you'll stick to your plan long-term.\n\nThe most comprehensive financial plans also look at your overall financial health, not just savings. For instance, if you're in debt, you should ideally have a plan in place for paying that down. An emergency fund is also important, because unexpected expenses will inevitably pop up -- and they could potentially throw off your entire plan if you don't have the money set aside to pay them.\n\nWhether you decide to create a financial plan on your own or with the help of a financial advisor, having a strategy in place for managing your money can make it easier to save for the future. No matter what you're earning or how much you have to save, a solid financial plan is always a good investment.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWho is this text intended for?\n- Financial advisors\n- Those interested in retirement planning\n- People struggling with their finances\n- Anyone looking to save money\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abThose interested in retirement planning\n\nThe text focuses on the importance of creating a financial plan for retirement and how it can positively impact savings.
