His nickname comes from a large locust invasion of the country that happened during his reign (most probably in 1539) and led to harvest loss, and famine.\n\nStephen was born after July 1496 in the capital city of Suceava, as the posthumous son of his father Alexandru of Moldavia, then the older son and heir of Stephen III the Great. His mother was Maria Asenina-Palaiologina a native Constantinopolitan of Byzantine imperial heritage. About 1\u20132 years after his birth due to succession for the throne ambitions by his step grand-mother, Maria Voichi\u021ba (3rd wife of Stephen III) who wanted to secure it to her son Bogdan-Vlad (future Bogdan III the One-Eyed), his mom takes him back to Constantinople where he will spend most part of his life before acceding to the throne at age 42. Based on his maternal origin and uprising in the Christian community of Constantinople as well as his direct nomination by the sultan he can be considered the first Phanariote ruler of Moldavia.\n\nIn the summer of 1538 he is appointed by sultan Suleiman the Magnificent as \"Voievode &amp; Hospodar\" of Moldavia and he will participate in the campaign against his predecessor and uncle Petru IV Rare\u015f. Petru was preparing to fight against overwhelming odds the sultan's army but he was deserted by most of his troops under the command of his grand boyars (nobles) the hetman (army commander) Mihul and logothete Trotusanul. Petru then flees in exile in Transylvania. Suleiman enters the city of Suceava, captures Moldavian treasury, battle flags and princely artifacts including Stephen IIIs sword and convokes formally the \"Sfatul Tarii\" (National Assembly) who sanctions unanimously his choice for the throne - Stephen V. As punishment for his predecessor's disobedience Suleiman also annexed the fortress of Tighina with surrounding area, a further territorial loss for Moldavia after prior conquest of Kilia and Cetatea Alba (Asprokastron) in 1484. This extended the country's vulnerability to attacks from South-West and caused discontent among the boyar elite and wider population. However otherwise the sultan renews Moldavia's autonomy and self rule and keeps unchanged the tribute at 10,000 gold coins annually.\n\nHis reign was noted mostly for the financial difficulties brought on by the locust invasion, but he appears to have made the best efforts to renew diplomatic relations with Hungary and Poland and, at the end of summer of 1540, took an increasing anti-Ottoman stance and even sanctioned a raid against Tighina which resulted in the death of about 150 Ottomans and confiscation per Polish contemporary accounts, of about 68,000 sheep.\n\nIn the meantime his ousted predecessor Petru IV Rare\u015f after public supplication in front of the sultan and after having paid the biggest bribe yet for a Romanian prince is re-appointed in early December by Suleiman after he received the news of Moldavian raid against his subjects. Before Petru IV Rare\u015f could reach Moldavia Stephen V is assassinated by a plot lead by the same grand boyars - Mihul and Trotusanul five days before Christmas 1540. They will receive their punishment soon thereafter once Petru reached Suceava, although in between these two events there will be a 5-6 week rule by Alexandru Cornea, another grandson of Stephen III the Great. Stephen V is the first ruler of Moldavia assassinated by his boyars.\n\nStephen's V wife, Cheajna (whose origin and age we do not have information), was pardoned and she was allowed to retain quarters within the princely palace but she had passed months thereafter and was interred at the Bistri\u021ba Monastery where Stephen V himself might have been buried as well.\n###\nWhat were the key political and social challenges facing Stephen V during his reign, and how did he address these challenges?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abStephen V faced several challenges during his reign, including a locust invasion that led to a famine, tensions with the Ottoman Empire, and a dispute with his predecessor over the throne. To address these challenges, Stephen V attempted to renew diplomatic relations with Hungary and Poland, and even sanctioned a raid against Tighina, resulting in the death of about 150 Ottomans and the confiscation of about 68,000 sheep. However, his attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was assassinated by a plot lead by his boyars.\u00bb\u00bb",

The 1856 limestone railway station is an unstaffed but heated shelter with telephones and washrooms, which opens at least half an hour before a train arrives. The shelter and platform are wheelchair-accessible.\n\nNapanee station is one of originally 34 first generation Grand Trunk Railway stations in Ontario from the same era as the opening of the line. Nine still exist, of which three remain in active service. The station building is owned and maintained by the municipality.\n\nRailway services\nAs of early May 2020, Napanee station is served by two domestic routes (with connections). Departures have been reduced to one per day in either direction due to the coronavirus pandemic (effective March 31, 2020).\n\nOttawa - Toronto Route\n\nMontreal - Toronto Route\n\nHistory\n\nThe original Grand Trunk stations were stone buildings constructed during or immediately after the 1856 opening of the GTR (now CN) mainline from Montr\u00e9al to Toronto. Nine survive today, including a pair at Napanee and Ernestown in Lennox and Addington County which were built from Kingston Limestone using similar design. The first generation \"Type C\" Grand Trunk stations (small stations in Napanee, Ernestown, Brighton) were stone rectangular buildings with four chimneys and five bays for arched windows on the long side and two on each end, under a pitched slate roof with elongated eaves and soffits supported by end rafters and triangular brackets.\n\nAt the time of the railway's construction, Bath, Ontario was a bustling lakefront manufacturing village with 400-1000 people. The rails led to a shift in population from Bath (which was not on the GTR mainline) to Napanee (well served by the York Road, Napanee River and Grand Trunk Railway). The railway also led to a shift in population away from small towns to larger centres such as Belleville and Kingston.\n\nAt one point, Napanee was served by two railways; the Grand Trunk (Montr\u00e9al-Toronto) and the Bay of Quinte Railway (Deseronto-Sydenham). The BQR was integrated into Canadian Northern Railway's mainline to Smiths Falls in 1910 and became part of CN when CNoR went bankrupt in 1918. The last fragment of this line was disconnected in 2010 at Napanee's historic Grand Trunk station; it crossed Hwy 401 to a Goodyear Tire and Rubber factory as a dead end after the rails to Smiths Falls were removed in the 1980s. The section from Strathcona to Smiths Falls is now the Cataraqui Trail.\n\nNapanee's station is now municipally owned and remains in active use. The train no longer stops at Ernestown, leaving a boarded-up but intact CN-owned station in a rural area at an inaccessible point on the CN mainline  west of Camden East Road. The other seven stations from this original set are CN-owned and in varying condition. Trains no longer stop at St. Marys Junction, Brighton and Prescott. Kingston's historic outer station, in use until 1974, is now abandoned and in ruins. Belleville's original station is intact but largely vacant as a new facility was built adjacent in 2012. The original Port Hope (1856) and Georgetown (1858) stations remain in active service.\n\nWith the exception of the removal of stone chimneys on the four corners, the exterior currently looks much as it did originally. The 1856 Napanee Station was provincially designated Feb 26, 1993 under Part 4 of the Ontario Heritage Act; Brighton Station obtained a similar designation in 2000. The other seven original stations are designated federally under the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act, a status which does not apply to the municipally-owned Napanee station as the railway no longer directly owns the building.\n\"\"\"\n\nWhat is the historic significance of Napanee railway station?\u00bb\nOutput (response): \u00abNapanee railway station in Napanee, Ontario, Canada is historically significant as one of the original 34 first-generation Grand Trunk Railway stations in Ontario built during the 1856 opening of the line from Montreal to Toronto. It is a limestone railway station that is unstaffed but heated with telephones and washrooms. It is an example of a historically significant architectural style, and it is one of nine original Grand Trunk Railway stations still standing in Ontario. As of early May 2020, it is served by two domestic routes (with connections) and is wheelchair-accessible.\u00bb\u00bb",
