{"id": "Perplexity.md", "contents": "---\n# Metric Card for Perplexity\n\nPerplexity (PPL) is a widely used metric for evaluating the fluency of language models. It measures how well a probabilistic model predicts a sequence of tokens, with lower values indicating better predictions. Specifically, it computes the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of a sequence. Perplexity is only applicable to autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT-2) and **cannot** be used with masked language models like BERT.\n\n## Metric Details\n\n### Metric Description\n\nPerplexity assesses the predictive capability of a language model by computing the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of a given sequence. It quantifies how uncertain the model is when predicting the next token. A lower perplexity score indicates better model performance, as it suggests the model assigns higher probabilities to the correct tokens.\n\n- **Metric Type:** Fluency\n- **Range:** $(1, \\infty)$\n- **Higher is Better?:** No\n- **Reference-Based?:** No\n- **Input-Required?:** No (Perplexity can be computed on output tokens alone)\n\n### Formal Definition\n\nGiven a sequence of tokens $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_T)$, the perplexity of $X$ under a language model with parameters $\\theta$ is defined as:\n\n$$\nPPL(X) = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{i=1}^{T} \\log p_{\\theta}(x_i \\mid x_{\\text{<}i}) \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $p_{\\theta}(x_i \\mid x_{\\text{<}i})$ is the probability assigned by the model to token $x_i$ given the preceding tokens.\n- $T$ is the length of the sequence.\n\nA lower perplexity value indicates that the model assigns higher probabilities to observed sequences, meaning it better predicts the given data.\n\n### Sliding-Window Perplexity\n\nFor models with a fixed context size (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA), perplexity cannot be computed over arbitrarily long sequences directly. Instead, a **sliding-window** approach is used, as described in the [Hugging Face blog on perplexity](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perplexity):\n\n- The input sequence is broken into overlapping **windows** of a fixed length.\n- Each window is passed through the model, and **only the log-likelihood of the newly introduced tokens** (not the entire window) is used in the perplexity calculation.\n- This approach better approximates full-sequence perplexity compared to na\u00efve chunking (which can overestimate perplexity due to loss of context).\n\nUsing this method, perplexity is calculated as:\n\n$$\nPPL(X) = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{i=1}^{T} \\log p_{\\theta}(x_i \\mid x_{\\max(1, i-k):i-1}) \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $k$ is the model\u2019s fixed context size,\n- The probability of each token $x_i$ is conditioned on a **sliding context of at most $k$ tokens**.\n\nThis method provides a **more realistic** evaluation of model fluency while efficiently handling long sequences.\n\n### Inputs and Outputs\n\n- **Inputs:**  \n  - A sequence of text tokens (typically output from a model)\n  - A trained language model (e.g., GPT-2)\n  - Tokenizer for processing input text\n\n- **Outputs:**  \n  - A scalar value representing the perplexity score of the input text\n\n## Intended Use\n\n### Domains and Tasks\n\n- **Domain:** Text Generation\n- **Tasks:** Language Modeling, Dialogue Generation, Storytelling, Code Completion\n\n### Applicability and Limitations\n\n- **Best Suited For:**  \n  - Evaluating the fluency of language models, especially autoregressive models\n  - Comparing the relative performance of different language models on the same dataset\n  \n- **Not Recommended For:**  \n  - Evaluating masked language models (e.g., BERT) since perplexity is undefined for non-autoregressive architectures\n  - Assessing high-level semantic coherence, factual consistency, or diversity in generated text\n\n## Metric Implementation\n\n### Reference Implementations\n\n- **Libraries/Packages:**\n  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perplexity)\n\n### Computational Complexity\n\n- **Efficiency:**  \n  - Perplexity calculation involves computing log-likelihoods for each token, making it computationally intensive for large datasets.\n  \n- **Scalability:**  \n  - Efficient when used with GPU acceleration but may become expensive for long sequences due to the need for multiple forward passes.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:**  \n  - Sensitive to tokenization choices; different tokenization schemes can yield different perplexity values.\n  - Models trained on specific domains may yield artificially low perplexity scores on similar datasets while failing on out-of-domain data.\n  \n- **Task Misalignment Risks:**  \n  - Perplexity measures token-level fluency but does not assess semantic correctness or factuality.\n  \n- **Failure Cases:**  \n  - Does not distinguish between grammatically correct but nonsensical text and genuinely coherent text.\n  - Perplexity values are not always comparable across different models due to differences in vocabulary and tokenization.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** Closely related to perplexity, as perplexity is the exponentiated cross-entropy loss.\n- **BERTScore:** Evaluates semantic similarity rather than fluency.\n- **ROUGE/BLEU:** Measure lexical overlap rather than model uncertainty.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- **Papers:**  \n  - Jelinek et al.
