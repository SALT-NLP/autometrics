Filtered constructor params for TER: {'name': 'TER', 'description': 'TER (Translation Edit Rate) is a metric that measures the number of edits needed to transform a system output into a reference translation. It quantifies translation quality by counting insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts, with lower scores indicating better translations.'}
